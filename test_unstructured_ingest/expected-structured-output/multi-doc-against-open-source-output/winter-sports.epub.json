Or who is so unacquainted with the affairs of\nthe village schoolroom at Christmas as not to have seen a solid\nbilliard-ball or a lively canary squeezed out of the side of a friend\u2019s\nhead? Such phenomena are by no means rare, and occur periodically all\nover England.

But no one believes that the disintegrated watch has\nbecome an omelette though ocular evidence\u2014seeing\u2014insists that it has. It\nwas a conjuring trick.

    "text": "For High Alpine resorts in winter are a conjuring trick of a\nglorious and luminous kind. Our commonsense, based on experience, tells\nus that ice is cold, but is melted by heat; and that snow is wet; and\nthat unless you put on a greatcoat when the thermometer registers frost,\nyou will feel chilly; and that if you frequently fall down in the snow\nyou will be wet through, and if you do not change your clothes when you\nreturn home you will catch a cold. All these things are quite obvious,\nand he who does not grant them as premises to whatever conclusion we may\nhappen to base on them, is clearly not to be argued with, but soothed\nand comforted like a child or taken care of like a lunatic. But High\nAlpine winter resorts give, apparently, ocular disproof of all these\nobvious statements, and those who go out to these delectable altitudes\nin favourable seasons see (which is ocular evidence) every day and all\nday the exact opposite of these primitively simple prepositions\nregularly and continually taking place. They sit in the sun, when they\nare tired of skating, and see that though a torrid luminary beats down\non the frozen surface, burning and browning the faces of their friends,\nthe ice remains perfectly dry and unmelted; they trudge through snow,\nand find that they are not wet; they see the thermometer marking\nanything up or down to thirty degrees of frost, and go out coatless and\nvery likely hatless, and are conscious only of an agreeable and bracing\nwarmth; they go ski-ing and all day are smothered in snow, and yet\nreturn dry and warm and comfortable to their hotels, and do not catch\nany cold whatever. Shakespeare once made an allusion of some kind (I\ncannot look all through his plays to find it) about hot ice, meaning to\nemploy a nonsensical expression. But it is the most striking testimonial\nto the magnificence\nof his brain that all he ever wrote meant something, although, as in\nthis instance, he designed it not to. For without doubt he was alluding\nto what appears to occur at St. Moritz or M\u00fcrren.",

Even\nwhen they were out in Switzerland they hardly believed what appeared to\nbe happening, for they found that if the weather changed, and instead of\nthe windless calm, or a light north-wind, the F\u00f6hn-wind blew from the\nsouth-west, warm and enervating, then, in proportion as the thermometer\nmounted, they felt increasingly cold. All these things, though they\nthought they saw and felt them, were of the nature of a conjuring trick,\nand they never, after their return to the lowlands, really believed\nthem. It was obviously impossible that they could have felt warm and\ndry, after being rolled in the snow. It must have been an illusion,\ncapable of immediate disproof if they now went out without a coat, or\nsat down on a snowy London pavement. A pleasant illusion, no doubt, but\nclearly an illusion.

I rather fancy that people who have never been to the\nhigh altitudes in winter, believe that all those who say they have done\nso, and come back and tell their friends that sun does not melt ice, and\nthat snow is dry, and that ten degrees of frost is an agreeable\ntemperature to stroll about in without a coat, are in some sort of\ninexplicable conspiracy. But the conspiracy is so widely spread now, and\nis still spreading so fast, that one\u2019s remarks on the subject are\nreceived with politeness nowadays, though still with incredulity. Some\nstrange wandering of the wits has taken possession of the conspirators,\nwho are otherwise harmless. And, such is the force with which their\nillusion holds them, and so anxious are they that credence should be\ngiven to it, that they employ some sort of skin-dye to add completeness\nto their strange tales, and appear with brown hands and faces when they\ncome back to the an\u00e6mic metropolis. They are clearly the victims of some\nobscure but infectious derangement of the brain, of which the chief\nsymptoms are those strange illusions and an immense appetite.... And, as\nI have said, the victims of these illusions, before they have spent many\ndays in England, are already themselves wondering whether all these\nthings really were so, or whether they were but the fabric of a pleasing\ndream. But they make plans to dream again about the middle of the\nensuing autumn, and for the most part find that the vision is\nrecapturable. It is all great nonsense; but if you take a suitable\nticket at a suitable time of the year, and go where that ticket will\nallow you, the nonsense is found to be recurrent.",

Certainly it\nwould be hard to say that anything in the world is more beautiful than a\nbeech-tree in spring, or a crimson rambler in full flower, or glimpses\nof the Mediterranean in a frame of grey-green olive-trees; and I am\ninclined to believe that it is partly the contrast which a sunny morning\nin winter among the High Alps presents to all that a Londoner has known\nor dreamed of hitherto that partly accounts for the ineffable\nimpressions it never fails in producing on him. And to that we must add\nthe exhilarating and invigorating effect of the still dry air, and the\nsun that all day pours Pactolus over the gleaming fields. In such an air\nand in such a flood of light all our senses and perceptions are\nquickened, the vitality of our organs is increased, and with the\nwonderful feeling of bien-\u00eatre which the conditions give, our\nappreciation is kindled too. I always feel that it must have\nbeen on a frosty morning that David said: \u201cI opened my mouth and drew in\nmy breath.\u201d And perhaps on that day the cedars of Lebanon were covered\nwith the crystals of hoar-frost, and below the snowy\nuplands the dim blue of the sea slept insapphirined at the bases of the\nshining cliffs....",

In such wise do\nI fly from my conscience\u2014conscience, I may remark, is one of the things\nthat everybody leaves behind when he goes to the High Alps: apparently\nit and other poisonous organisms, such as the bacillus of tuberculosis\ncannot exist in those altitudes\u2014while below my breath I again register\nthe frequently broken vow that I will be at home again by the middle of\nJanuary at the latest. For indeed it seems impossible to tolerate London\nany longer just now: the fogs have begun (these are the excuses with\nwhich I seek to stay the protests of conscience, before I fly from it),\nand for three days last week we lived in a thick and ominous twilight of\ndusky orange, tasting evilly of soot and sulphurous products. At\nintervals a copper-coloured plate showed itself above the house roofs:\nand, oh, to think that this mean metallic circle was indeed none other\nthan the hot radiant giant that in the happier climes was rejoicing to\nrun his course across the turquoise expanse of cloudless sky; that this\nremote and meaningless object was the same that sparkled on dazzling\npeak and precipice and turned the untrodden snows to sheets of diamond\ndust. Then after three days of Stygian gloom the fog was dispersed by a\nshrewd and shrill north wind, and for a whole morning snow fell heavily,\nwhich, as it touched the pavements and roadways of town more than\nusually befouled by the fog, turned into a\nbase and degrading substance resembling melting coffee-ice. The streets\nswam in the icy treacle of it, and motor-buses and other ponderous\nvehicles cast undesired helpings of it at the legs of foot-passengers.\nAfter this dispiriting day the weather changed again and a tepid\nsouth-westerly gale squealed through the streets. This was too much: I\nbought a quantity of what is known as sermon-paper and two new\nstylographs (this was another sop to conscience, and implied the\nintention of working out in Switzerland), made a few hasty and craven\narrangements on the telephone, and slid out of Charing Cross Station at\n2.20 P.M. precisely next day, leaving\nconscience, like an abandoned wife, sobbing on the platform.",

They are coloured by\nthat which awaits him at the end of them (like the sweetness of sugar\npermeating tea), and this particular progress is to me full of romantic\nhappenings. Dusk is already closing in before I reach the coast, and as\nthe train halts on the hill above Folkestone, before being towed\nbackwards down to the harbour, I can see the lights beginning to twinkle\nin the town and along the pier, which is surrounded by the great grey\nimmensity of the wave-flecked sea. A fine rain is falling dismally, and\nas I hurry across the slippery quay I am weighed down by an enormous\ngreatcoat (the pockets of which, I am sorry to say, are \u201csalted\u201d by\nvarious packets of cigarettes, which is why I wear it), and I stagger\nunder the weight of a suit-case, sooner than part with which\nI would die. For the French or Swiss railway companies often (no doubt\nwith humorous intent) arrange that the traveller\u2019s large luggage shall\nnot arrive for twenty-four hours or so after he has got to his\ndestination, and in less experienced years I have packed my boots and\nskates in these detained trunks, and have been obliged to wait in savage\ninaction till the railway company has come to the end of its joke, just\nas one waits for the end of a long funny story. Not so now: my\ninseparable bag contains my large and cumbrous skate-shod boots as a\nfirst charge, and after they have been stowed, the mere necessities of\nlife, like clothes and dressing-case, as opposed to its joys, fill the\nrest. Even in the harbour the steamer sways with the back-wash of the\nheavy seas outside, and the mooring-ropes squeak and strain to its\nunease. I stick in the narrow gang-plank that conducts in precipitous\nincline to the deck (at least the corner of my suit-case does, which is\npart of my identity); a faint and awful smell of red plush sofas and\ncold beef comes up from the stairs leading to the saloon; the\ntarpaulins, rigged up along the open passage between decks, flap\nuneasily and are buffeted by the rain-soaked wind, and sailors hurry\nabout with white japanned tin objects in their hands....",

Whenever I arrive at Berne it\nis always a grey chilly morning, just above freezing point, so that the\nicy streets are half slush. At first this used to depress me with\nominous forebodings of a thaw at the higher altitudes: now I know that\nall the winter through it is always just thawing at Berne, and that the\nsky there always is heavily be-clouded. I think a sunny frosty morning\nthere would cause me some considerable anxiety, for it would imply a\ncomplete upset of climatic conditions, and midsummer might\nbe expected to hold its abhorred sway on the heights. So in perfect\nequanimity I climb back again into our train\u2014heated to the temperature\nof the second hottest room in a Turkish bath\u2014and we jog in more\nleisurely fashion through the half-frozen villages towards the lake of\nThun. These villages are mainly composed of houses taken from the\nlarger-sized boxes of toys, with stones fastened down on their\nwood-shingle eaves to prevent their roofs blowing away, and with\nstaircases, clearly built for ornament, and completely unpractical,\nclimbing up the outside of their walls. Stations and banks and hotels\nseem to be constructed with a view to moderate permanence; the rest are\nclearly so made that they can be taken up and planted down somewhere\nelse. Then as we emerge on to the edges of the lake, higher hills begin\nto tower across its steely-grey levels, and rifts in the clouds that\nshroud their heads and hunched shoulders show glimpses of sun that shine\non the whiteness of snow. Mile after mile we pursue a meandering way\nalong the shores, and thread the darkness of hoarse tunnels, whose lips\nare fringed with dripping icicles, and the sense of something coming,\nsomething high and clear, begins to grow. Though in front, where\nInterlaken lies, a veil of grey-blue mist is interspersed between us and\nthat which, I know, soars above it, the clouds are beginning on all\nsides to become unravelled like wool-work pulled out, and through the\nrents and torn edges gleams of turquoise sky are seen. High up climb\nserrated rims of rock, cut vividly clear against the blue and fringed\nwith aspiring pines; higher yet, where the boldest of these brave\nvegetables can find no footing, further ridges appear austere and empty\nand gleaming. Yet these are but the outlying buttresses\nand ramparts of the great towers at the base of which they lean and\ncluster: to-night we shall sleep in an eyrie far above them, and far\nabove us yet will watch the unscaled precipices of the great range, over\nthe edge of which the unheeding stars climb and swim into sight all\nnight long, pouring the golden dew of their shining upon forest and\nglacier, until the snows are rosy with dawn.",

For I approached the lady of my adoration\nfrom the Concordia hut, and instead of feasting my eyes at every step on\nher queenly gracious carriage and maiden slenderness, I found that\nthe\ncloser I got to her the more did she appear round-shouldered, not to say\nhump-backed. In addition, a quantity of fresh snow had fallen, and we\nhad a long tiresome and utterly unexciting trudge, a hot and stodgy\naffair. I had imagined that ventures and perils would have to be\nencountered for this wooing and winning of her, with balancings and\npoisings on stairways of precipitous ice and needles of pinnacled rock:\ninstead she had to be solidly and laboriously and dully approached; it\nwas like wooing some great bolster or gigantic cow. For a little while\nafter that I cared nothing for her; she was a mature and silent barmaid\nof vast proportions, but gradually her charm and enchantment cast their\nspell over me again, the dissolution of which I intend never to risk in\nthe future, unless I approach her by a more hazardous and daring route.\nTo those who approach her dully, she gives herself dully: the more\ndaring wooer she may perhaps kill, but she does not bore him.",

Up it we steamed in a little angry rattling\nsnorting train, which cut itself in half to take some of its aspiring\ncontents to Grindelwald on the left, and others among whom I numbered\nmyself to Wengen and to M\u00fcrren. By the side of our way ran a turbulent\nmountain stream fed by the glaciers of the Oberland, too swift to freeze\naltogether, but with its backwaters and sheltered reaches covered over\nwith lids of ice. For all its glacier-birth steam rose from it in the\nicy air that hovered in shaded places, and the alders and hazels that\nhung over it were thickly encrusted with the marvellous jewellery of\nthe hoar-frost, spiked and parsem\u00e8s and refoliaged in wondrous\nwinter growth with tendrils and scrolls of minutest diamond-dust.\nNarrower grew the valley, steeper and taller the wooded hills that\noverhung it till at last we reached Lauterbrunnen, close to which the\nStaubbach, most amazing of all waterfalls, leaps a clear eight hundred\nfeet from the edge of the high plateau-shelf, which skirts along the\nmountain-side on to the rocks below. Even in summer, when the melting of\nthe snows that feed the stream make it of far greater volume than when\nthe stricture of frost is on it, the water, poured as from a jug-spout,\ndisintegrates in its fall, so that it reaches the valley more in wreaths\nof mist than in solid water, and collects again from the dripping rocks;\nwhile in winter its diminished volume is further spent in the\nmanufacture of the huge icicles that fringe the edge of its\nleaping-place, and hang in great streamers, the beard and hair, you\nwould say, of the very Frost-king himself, who sits at ease on this\nprecipitous throne. Little water to-day runs away from where the clouds\nof mist and water-smoke fall on the rocks, for most of them are frozen\nthere, and a layer of ice covers the boulders where they come to earth.\nFor here, so engorged lies the valley, so close to the great rampart of\nthe Oberland, that the sun which blazed on Interlaken has not yet\nsurmounted the barrier of mountain-peaks.",

Pine woods and rocks melted away below,\nstreaming quietly downwards; presently we were level with the top of the\ntowering precipice from which the Staubbach was discharged, and\npresently that too was left below.

For foreground was this narrow ledge of\nwhite fields dotted here and there with cattle-ch\u00e2lets, and pines\nscattered singly or in companies, all wearing plumes and tippets of snow\nthat made their foliage seem a black blot in the sunlight, and soon the\ncongregation of village roofs appeared, and M\u00fcrren stood bathed and\nbasking in sunshine, drowned, so to speak, in the sparkling champagne of\nthe invigorating winter morning.

But as is crystal to soap so are those\nradiant congelations of the High Alps to the same as seen beneath grey\nskies and unluminous days. Here, if snow has fallen, as sometimes\nhappens, while wind is blowing, it is driven into all manner of curving\nwave crests and undulations; then when the fall is over, the sky clears\nagain, a night of frost hardens and congeals the outlines, and the trees\nwear fine feathers and\nplumes of whiteness. As the snowfall packs with its own weight, there\ngrows on the surface of the fields a crust half snow, half ice, covered\nwith dazzling minute crystals. During the fall of the snow there has\nbeen moisture in the air, and often on that brilliant morning that\nsucceeds the fall, the air is full of minute frozen particles of water\nthat sparkle like the old-fashioned glass-decoration on Christmas cards,\nso that one walks through a shining company of tiniest diamond\nfire-flies. And the frozen surface of snow reflects the wonderful azure\nand gold of sun and sky, and here in the blaze it lies white beneath a\nvivid yellow, there in the shade a dim blue permeates it. After a few\ndays of hot sun more of the fall will have melted and slipped from the\ntrees, and they stand black-foliaged and red-trunked waiting for the\ndecoration of the hoar-frost. The one more night of frost covers every\nsprig and fir-needle with amazing spikes and fernlike sprays of minute\ncrystal. Wondrous are their growths, more particularly if, as sometimes\nhappens, some cold mist comes up from the valleys. Then with a craze for\ndecoration almost ludicrous, you shall see your friends with hair and\neyebrows bedecked with these jewels, each separate hair wearing its\nfrozen garniture, and their coats and stockings ornamented in like\nmanner. They grow white in a single minute almost; and such as have\nmoustaches, close to the moisture of their breath will suddenly turn to\nwalruses with long dependence of icicles. And yet\u2014here is a conjuring\ntrick again\u2014though ice and frost frame their faces they are conscious of\nno cold at all.",

    "text": "Marvellous, too, are the dealings of the frost with the running\nstreams and the lakes such as those at St. Moritz or Davos or Sils.\nOften, unfortunately, it happens that a snowfall will occur when they\nare but lightly frozen over, in which case the snow quite covers them,\nbreaks through perhaps in places, and with the ice already formed, makes\na rough uneven surface useless to the skater, and to the beholder no\nmore than a level snow-field, with perhaps ugly stains on it where the\nwater has come through and formed the grey ice, which is of no artistic\nmoment. But sometimes it happens that a snowfall occurs before any ice\nhas formed on the lake, and thus, though it lies on the surrounding\nground, it melts in the water, and at the end of the fall the lake is\nstill unfrozen, though the winter mantle lies over field and wood. Then\nlet us suppose there comes a hard frost with no more snow. Night after\nnight ice absolutely clear like glass forms on the water and gradually\nthickens. If the days are windless it is entirely smooth, and\npractically invisible, so that it is impossible to believe that you are\nnot looking on a sheet of water. Then the glad word goes forth that the\nlake bears, and you hurry forth to skate on it. But mountain and wood\nand landscape are all mirrored in it as in perfectly still water, and it\nis almost incredible that here is ice a foot or two thick. Tremblingly\nyou launch yourself on it, scarcely able to believe in its solidity; for\nthrough that unwavering surface you see every weed and stump under\nwater. The very fishes flit and flick visibly below your feet, and so\nglassy is it that through it it is possible to see the subaqueous\nfoundations of the lacustrine dwellings in the lake of Sils, never to be\nseen unless the lake is frozen, since the slightest ripple of the water\nsets the surface a-quiver and mars its translucency. But seen through\nthis foot or so of perfectly clear ice\u2014black ice, as it\nis called\u2014it is as if one looked through that charming contrivance\ncalled the bathyscope, by which you can observe the depths of the sea.\nBelow the ice, the water lies still and in a calm sheltered by this\nsolid ceiling of crystal, and you see, as if in an aquarium, the fishes\nand the water-weeds, and all the gales that ever blew will not shatter\nthe reflections or obscure the depths. Then when your courage has come\nto you, and you begin to grasp the fact that an army might march across\nthis invisible plain of ice without breaking through, you will no doubt\nventure forth from the shore, and feel what you never feel on rinks and\nother prepared surfaces of ice, the divine elasticity of your floor. And\nvery likely just when you are some half-mile from the shore, you will be\nterror-stricken to hear a crack as of artillery resound close to you,\nand a great crack will zigzag like lightning through the ice. The first\ntime you hear that, the present writer is willing to wager any\nreasonable sum that your face will blanch (unless too sun-tanned) and\nyou will skate with incredible celerity for the nearest land. But that\nsalvo portends no danger whatever, except if your skate-blade enters\nsuch a crack (of which there will be, unfortunately, a considerable\nnumber in the course of a few days) longitudinally. Then it is true you\nmay have a fall, but these explosions do not mean that you will ever be\nfood for fishes.",

Owing to dew, or from other moisture in the air, there begin to\nform upon the ice little nuclei of hoar-frost such as are seen in Plate\nVI. They look harmless enough, and with\nperfect justice you admire their exquisite fanlike fronds, and think no\nmore of them. But in a couple of days the same surface, as shown from\nthe identical point of view in Plate VII, presents a totally different\naspect, and one which is clearly discouraging to the most ardent of\nskaters. But then, since you are finally and completely and irrevocably\nthwarted in any ambition to skate on this depressing surface (for it is\nas if all the ice-moles in the world had made their common earth there,\nmultiplying exceedingly), you will be wise to examine and admire the\nastounding forms of this fairy frost-work before it becomes confluent,\nand, losing the individuality of its separate tufts, covers the whole\nlake like powdery snow.

In spring or summer or autumn\nit is broken by sounds of cowbells\nperhaps, and, almost certainly by a murmur of wind in pine-woods, or of\nwater hurrying from the heights. But in winter, on a still evening those\nevidences of life are dumb, and yet the silence itself is pregnant with\nvitality. At sunset the high tops burn in rose-coloured flame, and as\nthe glory fades into the toneless velvet of the frosty sky, the stars in\ntheir wheeling are of a brilliance utterly unknown to lower altitudes,\nexcept perhaps where the desert lies fallow and dry beneath Egyptian\nskies, and no emanation from the earth dims the burning of these \u201cpatins\nof bright gold.\u201d But that \u201cquiring to the bright-eyed Seraphim\u201d reaches\nnot the mortal ear, and at evening or at night in these High Alps, there\nis felt, as it were, that ecstasy of silence that seems on the point of\nbursting into chorus: \u201cit must get rid of what it knows.\u201d Nowhere else\nhave I felt so rapturous a quality of stillness: the frozen snow lies\ntaut under the grip of the immense energy of the frost: no avalanches\nslipping from the snow-laden flanks of the Jungfrau under the hot beams\nof the sun, startle the valley with sonorous thunder: the wind stirs not\nthe lightest needle of the pines; the villagers are home from the frozen\nfields, and doors are shut. Slowly the last rose-colour fades from the\npeaks, and the stars brighten, and you hold your breath to hear the most\nwonderful thing you have ever heard\u2014utter stillness, that yet is\nstrained almost to bursting point with the energies that make it, the\npeace that passes understanding that lies above the snow and beneath the\nstars....",

I therefore hasten to assure them\nthat lake skating in Switzerland does not count; indeed most\nwinter resorts have no lake at all; and even if they have, skating there\nis quite the exception and not the rule. In nine cases out of ten the\nsnow spoils the ice before it bears, and the frost-flowers spoil the\ngreater part of it, even if the snow has held off, almost immediately\nafterwards. Lake-skating, in fact, is of the nature of a bonus rather\nthan a dividend: to be enjoyed if it happens, but by no means to be\nreckoned on.",

These rinks are used for two purposes:\nskating, including bandy or ice hockey, and curling. I do not count\nice-gymkhanas or ice-carnivals, because anything is good enough for\nthem. You can play the shovel-game or crawl through barrels among the\njungles of frost-flowers.

This, if it is to\nbe the foundation of a well-and truly-laid rink in the ensuing winter,\nshould be done early in the spring, because the ground will have then\nhad time to settle down, and the inequalities which always occur in this\nsettling can be made good, before the first frosts of the autumn begin,\nand the soil gets fixed and frozen. Also, so I am told, the fact that\nthe ground will then be covered with a growth of weeds and grasses,\ncauses the foundation of the rink to be of better quality. This is\neasily understandable: the base is matted, and is probably more coherent\nin texture and less liable to contain holes through which the water may\ndrain away. Then, when the whole ground has been\ndoctored, i.e. when the small inequalities have been corrected\nand it is as uniformly level as can be expected of anything in this\nshifting world, everybody sits down and smokes (as is the habit of the\nSwiss peasant) till the first good snowfall comes, probably in November\nor early in December.

    "text": "A row of them (I am describing the most up-to-date method) stand\nclose together with arms interlocked, in as straight a line as may be,\nand trample down all this beautiful fresh snow. Up and down they go, in\nslow time, stamping heavily with their great feet, and making out of\nperhaps a foot of snow some 3 or 4 inches at the most, of really compact\nand hard foundation. It will resemble at the best, as regards evenness,\na lane over which flocks of ponderous sheep have passed; but the\ngroundwork (this is the main point) will be of hardened snow, though\nextremely rough of surface. Then they may all sit down and smoke their\npipes again\u2014all, that is, except the headman and those who pull about,\nat his bidding, the yards of hose which at one end terminate in a brass\nnozzle, at the other in the water-supply, which should run in the main\nat high pressure. This water is then turned on to the compacted snow\nwhich gets soaked with it, and, if a few nights of hard frost follow the\noriginal snowfall, becomes gradually converted into a sort of rough but\nglazed and solid ice. Then, if nothing untoward happens, in the shape of\nthaw or further snowfall, the next step is taken. But if there is during\nthese few days a thaw, they have to wait for more snow to fall, and do\ntheir trampling over again; while if there is more snow, the poor\nwretches have still to trample and get the foundations firm again. But\nif all goes well\u2014and the experienced iceman will delay the original\ntrampling until the barometer or his weather-sense (preferably the\nformer) promises cold weather to follow\u2014he makes his second operation.\nHe will have built a small bank of snow perhaps 3 feet high and\nwell-spaded down, round his rink, and have sprinkled that as well as his\nrink surface, so that it is at any rate glazed with ice and water-tight.\nThen, waiting for a bright sunny morning, he floods the whole rink with\nperhaps 2 inches of water. The sunniness of the day is most important\nfor this operation: if he put on this flood on a cold day, or at evening\nwhen a frosty night was imminent, all the water he put on, lying on the\ncold frozen surface below, and with the frosty air above it would freeze\nsolid without cohering to the original frozen foundation. But putting it\non while the sun is hot, the top surface of the foundation is percolated\nwith the flood, and when the frost of the night follows, the flood binds\nwith it. One night possibly may not consolidate the flood: if it does\nnot, he waits till another night completes the work. All the time, it\nmust be remembered, the rink presents the most depressing appearance:\nlittle bits of frozen snow have floated up to the surface, frost-flowers\nperhaps have made their ill-starred appearance, and it still somewhat\nresembles a sheep-trampled lane. But then things begin to look better:\nand another inch of water is put on, and then another inch, and then\nanother, each being consolidated before the next is applied, and each\nbeing applied not in the evening, but when the sun will slightly melt\nthe previous surface. With each of these floodings the ice grows more\ndesirably smooth, and more immaculately clean, till at the end of\nperhaps a fortnight there\nis something like 18 inches of solid ice over the ground that was\nlevelled in the spring. At least this thickness is required if the ice\nis to last properly, for even in mid-winter the most sickening series of\nclimatic catastrophes may occur, which, unless there is good thickness\nof ice originally built up, may spoil the rink altogether. For on hot\nsunny days, though the surface of the ice remains quite dry, very great\nevaporation occurs, and the dryness of the air drinks up the melted ice\nbefore it visibly or tangibly becomes water. Or again, even in the most\nwell-conducted winters, at the most approved resorts, there may be a\ncomplete thaw, and \u201cthe pools are filled with water,\u201d which also\nevaporates. In both these cases, there is a consequent loss of ice, and\nthe bullion, so to speak, must be able to stand the drain upon it. Still\nworse, there may be a snowfall followed by a thaw, followed by a frost.\nThe thaw has eaten into the ice; the frost has caused this rodent\nmixture to get encrusted again. And then, if there is not good depth of\nice, the most excruciating events tread on each others\u2019 heels. The\nground below the thin ice is warmed with the penetrating sun, and begins\nto exude bubbles; the bubbles rise, and horrible water-blisters, skinned\nover with ice, appear. The skates crash through them (\u201cand langwedge\nwhich I will not pollewt my pen with describing,\u201d as Miss Fanny Squeers\nsaid) and cut into the half-frozen ground, which thereupon begins to\nleak. The most awful mess ... there are no words for it. Therefore it is\nnecessary, as soon as possible, to get a good thickness of ice.",

    "text": "Now the shrinkage of the ice already gained goes on all winter long,\nowing to the evaporation of the surface, and owing to the cutting edges\nof skates, which cover it with a sawdust of frozen stuff that has to be\nswept off every evening. This perpetual loss must be made good, or else\nthe rink would soon vanish altogether, and it is made good by floodings\nor sprinklings. A flood of a couple of inches over the whole surface is\nof course the easiest way of doing this, but it is far the least\nsatisfactory. For, as I have said, the flood must be put on while the\nsun is still on the ice, to enable it to bind into the ice already\nformed, and thus hours of daylight are lost to the skater. Furthermore,\nunless a really severe night follows, it will not be all properly\nfrozen. So the good ice-maker, instead of turning skaters off the ice,\nand getting by one flood sufficient thickness to last for three or four\ndays more,\nsprinkles instead. This is a far longer and more troublesome process,\nfor with his hose-pipe with its small nozzle he has to go over the ice\nagain and again, six or seven times perhaps, or more, in a single night,\nif ice is badly wanted. If it is freezing hard, each sprinkle will\nsolidify almost as soon as it falls, and sometimes he sprinkles all\nnight long; while if it is far too warm for a flood to have a chance of\nsolidifying, he will, unless a real thaw is going on, still find it\npossible to sprinkle once or twice before morning, even though there is\nbut a degree or two of frost. Another immense advantage that sprinkling\nhas over flooding is, that ice thus made, little by little, in\nexceedingly thin layers, lasts, for some reason, far longer than a\ngreater thickness of ice frozen solid in a single night. Why this should\nbe so, I do not know; but the fact is incontestable. Certainly also a\nflood of a couple of inches frozen solid is far more brittle in itself\nthan ice built up in thin layers, and an awkward toe-strike with the tip\nof the skate will cut a great chunk out of flood-ice, whereas it makes\nfar less impression on sprinkled ice. The sprinkle should be thrown far\nand high (as illustrated in Plate XIII), so that it comes down on to the\nice in fine mist-like rain that freezes quickly and freezes tightly into\nthe ice already there. Of course all these difficulties are not\nencountered in a perfectly cold winter. Given a hard frost every night,\nit is easy to keep pace with the daily evaporation.

    "text": "Such in brief is the making of these rinks that seem such simple\naffairs when made, just a level piece of ice with a smooth surface. But\nthe knowledge, the care, the watchfulness which are necessary to\nsecure good ice that will last all winter and reasonably resist any\nthaws and snowfalls that may occur, are enormous. And the same care that\nis lavished on their making must be expended on their keeping. No one\nwith soil on his gouties or a cigarette even in his mouth should be\nallowed on the sacred surface, for even a feathery ash of tobacco if\nallowed to lie on the ice will get warmed by the sun and gradually melt\nits way into the ice. The sprinkle that night covers it, and it is\nembedded in the ice like a fly in amber. Again the sun shines on it, it\nmelts a little water round it, and forms the nucleus of what will spread\ninto a blister in the ice. Any dirt in the same way makes similar holes,\nand nothing but the clean skate-blade and the necessary and privileged\nboots of the icemen should ever be allowed on the rink. How amazed would\nbe the pioneers of outdoor artificial rinks if they could see the huge\nand perfect surfaces now yearly prepared for the hordes of foreign\nvisitors who flock to Switzerland. Of those pioneers John Addington\nSymonds was one, and in his charming essays he recounts how at Davos he\nand a few enthusiastic friends took exercise by incessantly working the\nhandle of a pump that stood in the middle of a level field, until, I\nthink, the pump froze. Then greatly daring they proceeded to skate over\nthe amazing ridges and shelves of ice which must certainly have been the\nresult of this hardy undertaking. Nowadays a reservoir must be built at\na sufficient height above the rink to secure a good pressure of water\nfor the sprinkling, and patient laudable men sit up all night watching\nthe thermometer to see if it is safe to offer water to the\ndelicately-nurtured crystal. But from these fine-art rinks has fine-art\nskating been evolved, and if the pioneers of rink-making\nwondered at our reservoir, our cohorts of workmen, our huge glassy\nsurfaces, still more perhaps would the skaters of those days be\nastonished to see some champion of the Continental execute his \u201cback\nloop change loop eight\u201d laying the loops on top of the other, or observe\nfour gentlemen of the English swoop down at top speed and on back edges\nto their centre, flick out four creamy rockers and glide away again to\ntheir appointed circumference. So much then for the skater\u2019s material\nneeds; we pass on to consider the use he puts them to.",

In past days, certain exponents of one or the other\nschool, with the mistaken idea that to belittle another was to magnify\nthemselves, fell into the stupid error of comparing the two to the\naccompaniment of robust vilifications of that style which happened not\nto be so fortunate as to number them among its adherents. But it is no\nexaggeration to say that the two styles have nothing whatever to do with\none another. It is true that the performer in each case is on skates,\nand that the skates progress over ice; but the very skates are\ndifferent; so, too, is the whole mode, manner, style, and effect of\nperformance, and it would be as reasonable for the Rugby football player\nto assert that Association is not real football, as for the English\nskater to label the International skater an acrobat or contortionist, or\nfor the International skater to call his detested English brother an\nexponent of the ramrod school.

    "text": "allowed to fly into their centre on a back edge with their unemployed\nleg waving, and there execute a rocker, there would immediately be a\nheap of mangled bodies on the ice, a result which is not recognised as\nbeing among the objects of combined skating; and similarly, in the\nInternational style, the graceful poses of arm and leg, which ignorant\nEnglish skaters look upon as mere display, are designed to assist the\nmovement. But in all other games (and this is where skating differs from\nthem all) the point is to achieve a certain object, and the achievement\nof that object, however attained, renders the achiever a notable\nperformer if he consistently attains it. The golfer, for instance, who\nconsistently drives a long straight ball, puts his mashie shot near the\nhole, and generally putts out, is a magnificent golfer, in whatever\nmanner or style he executes these tyrannously difficult feats. There are\na hundred and a hundred hundred styles and modes of putting, and they\nare all good, provided only they enable the putter to hole his ball. At\ncricket, similarly, a man may bowl fast or slow with any sort of break,\nand with any sort of action (provided his shirt sleeve is not wantonly\nflapping), and he is a good bowler if only he gets wickets cheaply. But\nat skating the prescribed thing has to be done in the prescribed manner,\nand the prescriptions of the English school are, broadly speaking, all\nof them diametrically opposed to the principles of the International\nschool. In the English style the employed leg (i.e. the one\nwhich for the moment is being skated on) must be straight; in the\nInternational style it must be bent. In the English style the unemployed\nleg must be close to the other, and hang beside it, loosely and easily;\nin the International, wherever the exigencies of\nthe movement demand that it should be, it must at any rate never be\nthere. In English the arms must not be spread and swung abroad to assist\nthe movement, but must be carried inactively by the side, whereas in\nInternational, as long as the skate moves the arms must be engaged on\ntheir assigned activity. In both schools, in fact, every movement must\nbe executed in a given way, but in no case is there the smallest\nresemblance between those ways, though both should result in clean edges\nand clean turns executed at defined places.",

    "text": "It is not my intention to give here a manual of English skating,\nbeginning with instruction to beginners and ending with timorous hints\nto experts, but any book on Winter Sports would necessarily be\nincomplete unless it babbled to some considerable extent about skating,\nwhich, without doubt, is the sport in pursuit of which the large\nmajority of English folk visit the High Alps in winter. From whatever\ncause, this slippery art exercises a unique spell over the able-bodied\nand athletic section of Anglo-Saxon mankind. It may be that this is\npartly accounted for by the comparative rarity of the occasions on which\nwe can skate, owing to our Gulf-Stream-beridden and generally\npestilential climate, and it is sufficient that some puddle-place in a\nvillage green should be half-frozen to cause the majority, not only of\nyouth but of sedate men and women, to hurry down to the spot, and there\nslide about on both feet with staggerings and frequent falls and the\never-present possibility of occasional immersions. But the rarity of\neven half-frozen puddles in England does not wholly account for the\ntranscendent spell: there is something in the\nquality of motion which is started by a stroke of the tense muscles, and\nthen continues of its own accord, without effort or friction, until the\nimpetus is exhausted, that appeals to our unwinged race, who must\notherwise keep putting foot before foot to get anywhere. The sensation\nitself is exquisite, and the sensation is rendered more precious by the\nfact that from the days when the tyro slides cautiously forward on both\nfeet, to the days when, having become a master in his art, he executes\nback-counters at the centre in a combined figure, there is always a\nslight uncertainty as to what is going to happen next. The tyro\nrejoicing in the unaccustomed method of progress is conscious of a\npleasing terror as to whether he will not fall flat down, and glows with\ncallow raptures all the time that he does not; while the finest skater\nwho ever lived, will never be quite sure that he will flick out his\nback-counter cleanly and unswervingly. We can all walk pretty\nperfectly\u2014at least, there is no pleasing terror that we may be going to\nfall down\u2014but none of us at our respective levels as artists in skating\ncan skate pretty perfectly. We can only skate moderately well,\nconsidering how well we can skate. And the joy of it! The unreasoning,\ndelirious joy of the beginner who for the first time feels his outside\nedge bite the ice, and, no less, the secret elation of the finest\nperformers in the world, when they execute their back-counter close to\nthe centre, at high speed, and without the semblance of flatness in the\nedge! And even if any of us was so proficient as to perform such a feat\nwith absolute certainty, there is no doubt whatever that we should find\nsome further feat that would put us back into the dignified ranks\nof\nstragglers again. And the same holds good with regard to International\nskating: at least if there is any among those delightful artists who\nwill execute the Hugel star first on one foot and then on the other\nwithout a pleasing anxiety gnawing at his heart, I should very much like\nto know his name and black his boots for him.",

A further\ndevelopment of combined skating, namely, combined hand-in-hand skating,\nhas not long ago been undergoing a successful evolution, under the\nauspices chiefly of Miss Cannan, Lord Doneraile and Mr. N.

In both the technique, so\nto speak, is the same.

He must be standing erect with his shoulders and body\nsideways to the direction of his curve, not facing square down it.\nIn other words, he must, among other things, be travelling not further\nforward than on the middle of his skate, otherwise he will not be\nstanding erect, but leaning forward. This attitude is that which is\nreferred to, in the humorous book I have already quoted, as\ncharacteristic of the ramrod school. But the author, in his blissful\nignorance of skating matters, is not aware that it is impossible\nto execute a long smooth circumference of curve if you progress on the\nforepart of your skate. If you are on the forepart of the skate, you\nmust be leaning forward, and no one of known anatomy can lean forward\nand execute a long smooth edge. The balance is unsteady, and the edge\nwobbles. Commonsense, then, again endorses this rule. In order to be\nsteady on a long edge, your balance must be of the established order.\nYou must be upright, and travelling without muscular effort to retain\nyour position. This is only attained by travelling on the middle or the\naft part of the skate. For nobody can stand still on their toes. But\nstanding on the middle part of the foot or with the weight on the heel\nit is perfectly easy to do so. But when this humorous author (whom I\ndrag out of his obscurity for the last time) calls this the ramrod\nschool, he proves himself ignorant of the first principles of English\nskating, or perhaps has only observed himself in some mirror at Prince\u2019s\nClub attempting to assume the correct attitude himself. As a matter of\nfact, the proper attitude of the skater in the English style is exactly\nthat of a man who is well made and master of his limbs standing still\nwith the weight chiefly on one foot. While skating, it is true, the\nweight is entirely on one foot, and the performer is moving, and not\nstanding still. But the pose necessary to smooth and swift progression\nis exactly that. It no more resembles a ramrod, when decently done, as\nevery good English skater does it, than it resembles a coal-scuttle or a\npince-nez, or what you will.",

    "text": "Now if the skater will take the trouble to conform to the four rules\ngiven above, he will find that even at the outset of his career there is\ngreat fun in store for him. Should he conform to them completely, when\nthe complication of turns is added, he will quite certainly find that\nthere is a championship, if he cares for that, in store for him also.\nThe rules were not negligently made; indeed they were never made at all,\nbut are simply the condensed experience of the best skaters, the methods\nby which the\nfittest survived. And the fittest did, and always will do, that which is\nrecorded in these rules, and the ensuing complications, even the most\ncomplicated of them, are comparatively easy to those who can maintain\nthe proper travelling position. But nobody who cannot hold a long firm\nedge, for which the proper travelling position is essential, need ever\ntrouble his dreams with the notion of becoming a good skater. And no\none\u2019s edges approach perfection, if he cannot traverse, on backward and\nforward edges, outside and inside alike, a distance of at least a\nhundred yards, given that the ice is reasonably good, without stirring\nfrom the attitude he has taken up after his stroke. A really fine skater\nwill traverse much more, and be still as a rock throughout his travel;\nbut no good skater will be so unsteady that he will not easily traverse\nthat. In his actual skating he will, probably, never be called upon to\nmake so lengthy an edge, but its accomplishment should present no\ndifficulty to him, if he aspires to be a fair performer. Even as the\npianist, when performing, is not called upon to play simple scales with\nboth hands, so the skater will not be called upon, in his combined\nfigure, to skate for a hundred yards on one edge. But both pianist and\nskater ought to find no difficulty at all in executing these simple\nfeats.",

    "text": "Here, it will be seen, the test begins with a combined figure. The\nwhole subject of combined figures will be treated of separately, and\nfor the present we need only remark that this is a very simple one. Then\nfollow the inside back edge, which, as I have said, is the most\ndifficult of the edges, skated larger than before, in curves of 20 feet,\nand the cross-stroke on the outside back. This means that the stroke is\ntaken with the feet crossing, the one that is taking the stroke being\ncrossed behind the other. As a matter of fact, this stroke, which at one\ntime played a considerable part in English skating, since in combined\nfigures all strokes from outside back to outside back were bound to be\ntaken from the crossing position, is now not obligatory. But it is a\npretty stroke in itself, and necessitates the skate being placed on the\nice on the edge. Then follow the two forward turns, skated rather large,\nin order to begin to familiarise the learner with the feeling of turns\ntaken at a high speed. This necessitates clean skating of the turn\nitself, since if a turn is skated fast, and not clean, it is quite\npossible that the skater may fall, and he will in any case make a blur\ninstead of a sharp cut turn. Also these turns teach him to hold his\nedges out after the turn, the tendency being to let the body rotate,\nwhereby the curve curls in, and the skater soon finds himself in a\nposition that it is impossible to maintain. But if he skates his turn,\nand then can hold an edge for 50 feet away from it afterwards,\nhe may congratulate himself on the fact that he is beginning to skate\nhis edges big and in the proper style. For these cannot, practically\nspeaking, be held out, unless the rules for position are being conformed\nwith. Then follow four simple figures of the class known as 8\u2019s, of\nwhich the simplest is that required in the third-class test, namely, an\noutside forward 8. All 8\u2019s, as their name denotes, are of the same\ngeneral shape, i.e. the shape implied by\ntheir name, but between the edges that trace the shape of the 8, the\nskater is now required to put in certain turns. He starts, for instance,\non an outside forward edge, when half round his circle makes a three\nturn, and comes back to his centre on the inside back edge. Or he starts\non an inside forward edge as in the third 8, and has to make two turns\nbefore he arrives at his centre again, which he reaches as an inside\nforward edge. Or, more searchingly, he has to start his 8 on an outside\nback edge, and make two turns and aim at his centre again on an outside\nback edge.",

What is meant is\nthat he has now run up against the really crucial difficulties in\nEnglish skating, of which perhaps the greatest of all is to stand still,\nas the Irishman might say, while moving rapidly. As will be already seen\nin this test, he is required to do this for somewhat extensive travel:\nin his outside forward turn, for\ninstance, he has to proceed for at least fifty feet on his forward edge\nbefore making his turn, and the same distance on his back edge after\nmaking his turn. And though this present disquisition is intended to be\na statement of English skating and not a book of instruction, the writer\ncannot bear to let this one opportunity slip of giving just one hint. It\nis perfectly impossible to travel steadily for distances like these\u2014and\nthe skater will have to learn to go much further yet on his edges\u2014if he\nis travelling on the forepart of his skate. All forward turns, by the\nslight check they give to the speed (I am not now talking of those ideal\nskaters who actually get speed out of a turn), tend to put the skater\nfurther forward on his skate. He must therefore approach all forward\nturns on the back part of his skate, so that by this tendency to rock\nforward he will make the turn itself on about the middle of the skate.\nNever for a moment, if he can help it, must he get on the toe of his\nskate, and if ever he does, he must regain position again by leaning\nfearlessly back. And in this second test, he will find that the\ndifficulty of travelling well back on his skate is at first appalling.\nBut having learned that, and learned it thoroughly, he will probably not\ncome across any subsequent requirement which appears to him so clearly\nimpossible.",

To pass this final test the skater has to be\nable to execute all the threes (the two simple ones are omitted, as they\nhave already been required in the second test), rockers, brackets,\ncounters, mohawks, and choctaws at fair speed and on large edges at a\ngiven point on the ice. Having done that to the satisfaction of the\njudges, he has then to make his selection from a large number of 8\u2019s,\nwhich include practically most possible 8\u2019s comprising one or two turns,\nexcepting these simple ones with regard to which he has already\nsatisfied the judges in his second test. Here he has to score marks,\nselecting not more than one 8 of each group, and by the devilish\ningenuity of those who drew up this test, it is impossible for him to\nget through unless the majority of the 8\u2019s he selects to skate are\nreally difficult. He may then add to his marks by executing what are\ncalled reverse Q\u2019s at two given points on the ice. At the first of these\nhe has to make his turn, whatever it is, and at the second to change his\nedge. This requires a considerable degree of accuracy, for in order to\narrive smoothly and still at a fair travelling pace at the second point,\nhe will find that he has to have a practically perfect control of the\nedge, which has not been disturbed by executing a difficult back turn,\nlet us say, at the first given point. Finally, if he is still in want of\nmarks, he may earn a few more by a grape-vine. This latter does not\nproperly belong to English skating, since it is a two-footed figure, and\nthose responsible for the test might have omitted this group with\nadvantage.",

Theoretically it can be skated by two, four, six, or\neight persons: practically it is skated by four persons, grouped, at the\nbeginning of things, at right angles to their neighbours, and at a few\nyards distant from their centre. One of these, who skates in the first\npair, is known as the caller, and he announces (in a loud mellifluous\nvoice) what he is about to skate, and what the trembling gentleman\nopposite, who is his partner, must also skate. They advance to the\ncentre, from opposite sides, and begin skating whatever is ordered. The\nmoment after they have left their centre, speeding out to the\ncircumference of the huge imaginary circle, of which their orange or\nindia-rubber ball, from which they have started, is the centre, the\nsecond pair (at right angles to them) proceed to do exactly the same.\nThe size and pace of the figure, as well as its details, depend entirely\non the caller: as he skates, so must his partner skate, putting down his\nedges and turns simultaneously and at like speed to him, and as the\nfirst pair skate, so (with certain modifications) must the second pair\nskate.",

He can\n(and does) order threes, brackets, rockers, counters, mohawks, choctaws\nand changes of edge to be skated when and how he wishes them. He can\n(and does) couple any pair or any three of these movements, to be skated\non one foot or on both, one after the other. He directs, with a word of\npower, from the elaborate vocabulary of combined skating, the length of\nan edge, and can command it to be held so long that the direction of\nprogress is reversed, or to be further continued till a complete circle\nis made and the original direction of progress resumed again. Then, with\nanother word, he brings himself and his partner (followed\nclosely by the second pair) back to their centre again, on the off side\nor the near side of it, and orders that they shall start a fresh figure\nthere, or that they shall make a turn there, or scud by it like four\nexpress trains which just, and only just, arriving from the four parts\nof the compass, do not collide with each other, and scatter again to\neast and west and north and south. Sometimes he brings them in\nsimultaneously, so that they converge till they almost touch, and then\nspread out again. And if the figure is going decently well, there is no\npause, no foot without its edge and turn assigned to it. This mystic,\nswift, interweaving dance lasts perhaps a quarter of an hour of hard,\nenraptured skating.",

All leave the centre simultaneously, all (it\nis hoped) arrive back at it simultaneously. Since there is no crossing\nof pairs at the centre, a far larger number of skaters can take part in\nit, as they have not to wait for a prior pair to clear, and if\nelementary calls only are ordered, upwards of ten or twelve skaters can\njoin the dance with effect. No one of them, as in pair skating, crosses\nthe path of another skater: they leave and arrive at the centre on\nconverging not crossing lines. Thus it is an easier sport than is\ncrossing pairs, since in the latter case the edges that leave and\napproach the centre intersect each other.

Necessarily the\nfigures compassable by a man and woman hand in hand are fewer in number,\nas at present worked out, than those which can be skated by single\nskaters, and the speed at which such figures are skated is less than in\nthe combined skating of single skaters. Hand-holds have to be changed,\nand partners brought into the new position required by turns, &c.,\nby pulls, or by what in the nomenclature is called \u201csteps\u201d\u2014i.e.\nsingle strokes and edges. Already this style has taken the place in the\nannual championship of English skating, and without doubt it will grow\nboth in the number of its practitioners, and in the force and speed of\ntheir movements. It is scientifically based, being evolved from the\ncharming movements that are possible to hand-in-hand skaters when going\nfree on the ice, and not bound to consider their opposing partner, or to\narrive in a given manner at a given point. But it resembles, at present,\nin the opinion of the writer, the performance of a yearling. It requires\nthe devotion of a dozen first-class skaters of both sexes to determine\nits possibilities. His wish is, that it will get them. His fear is that\nthe necessarily cramping influence of conjoined hands will prove to\ndebar it from the speed and largeness of other branches of English\nskating. He sincerely hopes that his fears are quite unfounded.",

    "text": "Here is a remarkably varied programme, and one that will obviously\ngive a good spell of regular work to a candidate who intends to grapple\nwith it. It contains more of the material for skating than does the\ncorresponding English second test, in which only the four edges, the\nfour simple turns, and the four changes of edge are introduced, since\nthis International second test comprises as well as those, the four\nloops, and two out of the four brackets. These\nloops, which are most charming and effective figures, have nowadays no\nplace in English skating, since it is quite impossible to execute any of\nthem, as far as is at present known, without breaking the rules for\nEnglish skating, since the unemployed leg (i.e. the one not\ntracing the figure) must be used to get the necessary balance and swing.\nThey belong to a great class of figures like cross-cuts in all their\nvarieties, beaks, pigs-ears, &c., in which the skater nearly, or\nactually, stops still for a moment, and then, by a swing of the body or\nleg, resumes or reverses his movement. By this momentary loss and\nrecovery of balance there is opened out to the skater whole new fields\nof intricate and delightful movements, and the patterns that can be\ntraced on the ice are of endless variety. And here in this second\nInternational test the confines of this territory are entered on by the\nfour loops, which are the simplest of the \u201ccheck and recovery\u201d figures.\nIn the loops (the shape of which is accurately expressed by their names)\nthe skater does not come absolutely to a standstill, though very nearly,\nand the swing of the body and leg is then thrown forward in front of the\nskate, and this restores to it its velocity, and pulls it, so to speak,\nout of its loop. A further extension of this check and resumption of\nspeed occurs in cross-cuts, which do not enter into the International\ntests, but which figure largely in the performance of good skaters. Here\nthe forward movement of the skate (or backward movement, if back\ncross-cuts are being skated) is entirely checked, the skater comes to a\nmomentary standstill and moves backwards for a second. Then the forward\nswing of the body and unemployed leg gives him back his checked and\nreversed movement.",

    "text": "This free skating is a charming item in the system of International\nskating, and might, with great advantage, be introduced into the English\nbranch. It is in itself perfectly fascinating to look at, and from the\ntechnical point of view it is quite admirable as a test of knowledge. A\ngood programme will contain dozens of turns and changes of edge, all\nmelting into each other without break or pause. None who have seen the\nfree skating of a fine performer can ever forget or question the\nbrilliance and variety of this three-minute free skating. As likely as\nnot, he will make his entry on to the rink in a spiral edge, and before\nit has come to rest at the centre, start off on his coruscating\nperformance. Rockers, brackets, counters, and turns succeed each other\nwith bewildering rapidity; and all are performed with the utmost ease\nand grace. It seems impossible to tell where the motive-power comes\nfrom, so smooth and effortless is the travelling; you would have said\nthe skater was wafted by some localised wind, or impelled by some\ninvisible mechanism. But before he arrives at this part of his test, he\nhas to skate his compulsory figures, the list of which is subjoined.",

It is this accuracy which makes the\nInternational style so hard of achievement in its higher branches; to\nhope to get through this list of searching figures, it is clear that the\nbalance, the pace, and the power of the skater must be in perfect\ncontrol. And all the time the\nappearance of insouciant freedom is there, though all the time that\nfreedom is bound by laws as relentless as those which regulate the\ntranquillity of the English style.

Every bar of the music which accompanies it has its\nappropriate movement: it is a perfect song of motion set to the band.\nBut the beauty and swing of it are things quite indescribable; one might\nas well hope to reproduce the dancing of Pavlova in pen and ink as to\nconvey any sense of it to those who have not seen it. And those who have\nseen it would very wisely yawn and pass on if they observed a purple\nparagraph on the subject looming ahead. But thistledown is not so light\nin a warm west breeze, nor the curves of a swallow\u2019s flight more\ndeliciously unconjecturable than a well-matched pair in this pastime so\nperfectly preconcerted that it looks entirely unrehearsed.

Epicure though the skater\nis, with regard to the smoothness and levelness of his ice, the curler,\nquite rightly, is even more exigent, and slight slopes of surface and\nminute inequalities and roughnesses which do not interfere with the\nskater at all, make it impossible for the curler to have a satisfactory\nrink. In any case, the curler\u2019s portion must be roped off from the\nskating part of the rink, for, naturally, no skate blade must make the\nsmallest scratch on his sacred enclosure; while, on the other side, the\ncurler is liable, in the ecstasies of his \u201csooping,\u201d to shed and scatter\npieces of broom which wander on to the skater\u2019s ice and cause falls.\nBesides, the skip habitually shouts at the top of his voice, and a good\nstone evokes choruses of open-throated music: thus, if many curlers are\nshouting at the top of their voices, combined skaters cannot hear the\ncaller, unless he shouts at the top of his voice. If he does this while\nskating a figure, he will speedily become purple in the face and quite\nbreathless. Also, the curler smokes when he curls, which tempts the\nskater to do likewise, and for the sake of the rink he must not. For\nthose and many other reasons, the curler should, when possible, have\na\nseparate rink of his own, where he can soop and shout and smoke without\ninterfering with anybody.",

As in all forms of sport where delicacy or\n\u201ctouch\u201d are essential to success, occasional practice is not enough to\nproduce really first-rate curlers, or, indeed, to keep the first-rate\ncurler at the top of his game; and any who wish to excel must have\nconstant practice, such as Swiss or Canadian winters give him. But\nCanada is a far cry to go a-curling, and we may put down the\nvastly-growing number of curlers, and their growing skill, to the\nopportunities afforded by Switzerland. There, all day long, in a\nbrilliant sun and yet on unsoftened ice, harder and faster than is ever\nprocurable in English or Scotch winters, the game goes on, and I do not\nknow of a single Swiss resort where provision is not made for those who\npractise this delightful sport.",

    "text": "In other words, then, you start with a point on the ice, which is the\n\u201ctee,\u201d and using this as a centre you draw round it a circle of 7-foot\nradius. This is done by means of a lath or strip of wood with two nails\nor steel points projecting from the lower face, 7 feet apart. Inserting\none of these in the centre you pull the lath round, so that the other\nscratches on the ice a circumference at a distance of 7 feet. As stated\nin Rule 2, \u201cadditional circles\u201d may also be drawn. These circles are\ndrawn from the same centre, with a radius of 2\u00bd and 4 feet respectively\nfrom it. This is done for convenience in measuring the distance from the\ntee of stones lying within the 7-foot radius, as it gives additional\nlines of measurement. This whole system of circles with the central tee\nis called \u201cthe house,\u201d and, as we shall see, all stones which, after\nbeing played, have come to rest with any part of them lying within the\nhouse, may add to the score of the side which has projected them there.\nBehind the house, in the position specified in Rule 3, is placed the\ncrampit. This is a strip of iron long enough for the player to stand on\nwith one foot in advance of the other. It is roughened with spikes on\nits lower side, so that it maintains a firm position on the ice, and at\nthe back of it is a ridge against which the player places his right foot\nbefore delivering the stones. It forms, in fact, a firm base for playing\nfrom, since, if anybody attempted to put down a curling-stone, while\nstanding on the ice itself, with sufficient velocity to make it slide\nover the 42 yards to the other tee, he would quite certainly slip and\nput himself down instead. It is from a crampit that almost all curlers\nnowadays play. As an alternative they may use what is in the rule called\na \u201chack,\u201d which is a small iron contrivance fixed to the boot, and which\nanswers the same\npurpose as a crampit. But it is not, in Switzerland anyhow, often seen,\nfor it requires adjustment for each individual player, whereas the\ncrampit fits all alike.",

Somewhat pathetically this\nrule presupposes that there is always \u201cswept snow\u201d at the side of the\nrink, which, happily, is not the case. As a matter of fact the space\nallowed for each rink is, roughly speaking, about 20 feet, though I am\nnot aware that it is laid\ndown authoritatively anywhere. In any case a stone, to be of the\nslightest use, must be lying not so wide as 10 feet (lateral\nmeasurement) from the tee, and those lying wider, as well as those which\nhave definitely passed beyond the back-score, cannot conceivedly come\ninto play, and so may as well be removed. But the case is different with\nstones lying short of the hog-score, and in a straight line between the\ntees. Such stones, as will be readily understood, might possibly be of\nthe utmost value to guard other stones lying in the house, and perhaps\nto be promoted into possible scorers. A guard, then, which is so\nimportant an item, must be put down with some skill, and with requisite\nstrength, and thus it is laid down that stones lying short of the hog\nare considered not to have been sufficiently skilfully played to take\npart in the game and be of value to their side.

Often, if sweeping is an urgent necessity, both he and No. 1\nwill vigorously scour in front of the progressing stone, since often in\nthe ensuing situations it is not a question of additional feet that are\nrequired, but of an inch or two. There may be a stone in the house\nalready, and it is doubtful whether an opposing stone has \u201clegs\u201d or\nvitality enough just to pass it, and thus lie nearer to the tee. In such\na case all possible assistance must be rendered it; the skip will career\nwildly out of his house and join No. 3 and No. 1 in their operations.\nAnything, anything to give this dying stone an inch more of travel!...\nAlso, a stone with smooth ice in front of it will travel more directly,\nthat is with less curl upon it, as it is becoming moribund, than a stone\nwhich has the infinitesimal fractions of tiny frost-flower or moisture\nto encounter.

The\nobject now will probably be to get past those stones, and, by the twist\nimparted to the stone No. 2 now delivers, to lie behind one or other of\nthem in the house, and thus be guarded. If this shot is perfectly played\nthere will be lying a stone close up to the tee and incapable of being\ndirectly attacked (i.e. by a hard shot played down straight on\nto it), for the guarding stone in front of the house prevents this, and\nit is a very different thing to be obliged to play round this guarding\nstone so as to hit the other. Thus it may be necessary for the opposing\nskip to direct that this guard should be removed by a fast straight\nstone, so as to open up the house again. But this costs a stone, even if\nsuccessful, and stones are not lightly to be squandered. Should this\nshot come off, the first skip will probably direct that another guard be\nlaid to protect this asset in the house. Having once got a stone in a\nprobably winning position, the skip is right to guard it and to guard it\nand to guard it, directing that stones should be laid to right and left\nof it, so as to block the passage of a stone which, by curling inwards\nor outwards, can reach and dislodge it, and perhaps lie there in its\nplace. Practically speaking, a stone which lies close to the tee should\nbe guarded at the cost of every stone belonging to the side if necessary\n(i.e. if the guards are being removed by the enemy), and no\nskip in his senses will direct his player to put other\nstones in the house until he has rendered reasonably secure from attack\nthe stone of his which lies close to the tee.",

Among other values they\npossess they are also capable of being promoted\u2014i.e. a\nsubsequent player may be directed to hit one of them gently, so as to\npush it into the house, while his will lie there in its place guarding\nit. Or he may be told, if the stone in question is lying rather wide, to\nget an inwick off it\u2014i.e. play on to the inner side of it, as\nin the manner of a half-ball shot at billiards, and, cannoning off it,\nslip into the house himself.

And the\nfirst consideration is the stance which the player takes up on the\ncrampit before delivering his stone. Here, as at golf, there are\ngreat varieties of stance, all of which are perfectly right and proper,\nprovided the curler can deliver his stone from them with effect. But, as\nat golf also, there are certain principles that will be found common to\nall those stances, and perhaps the most important of all is that the\ncurler should feel perfectly comfortable and be maintaining his stance\nby balance and not by muscular effort. In every case again (if\nhe be right-handed) his right foot will be firmly resting against the\nrim at the back of the crampit, for it is there that he gets the\npurchase which enables him to give the needful velocity to his stone.\nSimilarly, his left foot will be advanced, and he will be facing full in\nthe direction in which he is about to send his stone, and his left foot\nwill also be pointing in that direction. He will also be bending down,\nsince he has not to drop or fling the stone on to the ice, but to place\nit\u2014to lay it there smoothly with a forward swing of his arm and body.\nBut any kind of divergence is proper as regards this stooping attitude:\nsome men get their stone down to the ice by bending the body strongly\nabove the hips, keeping the legs comparatively straight, while others\nget down by bending the knees so far that they are sitting on their\nright heel, and their right knee is absolutely touching the crampit. And\nall these styles are perfectly right provided only that (i) the player\nfeels comfortable and unstrained; (ii) he can get his stone well down on\nto the ice; (iii) his head is facing and his eyes looking in the\ndirection of his skip\u2019s besom. All three of these provisions are\nessential to successful curling, and if one thing can be more essential\nthan another, it is that the player should be looking straight at the\nskip\u2019s besom.",

Then arm and body\ncome forward together, without muscular exertion and without pressing,\nand the stone is placed on the ice, while the weight of the whole body,\nwhich at the top of the swing was on the right leg, has come forward on\nto the left. Should the ice be slow, greater force is given to the stone\nby a longer swing, and should the ice be fast the swing is shortened.\nBut in no case, if the ice is playable on at all, should the impetus be\nderived from a muscular effort of the arm as in throwing; but as in\ngolf, the swing of the arm and body together give the stone its impetus.\nAnd throughout the swing the eyes of the curler must never leave the\ndirecting besom of his skip.

    "text": "Now there is a very important item in the swing at golf called the\n\u201cfollow-through.\u201d This means that after the ball has been hit and is on\nits way, the club and the hands and arms holding it fly out after it,\nwhile the whole weight of the body goes on to the left foot. There is no\nquestion that what happens to the club and the arm and player generally,\nafter the ball has gone, cannot make the least difference to the flight\nof the ball, but this \u201cfollow-through\u201d is a symptom, an indication of\nwhat has already taken place, and if the follow-through is satisfactory\nand full it shows that the swing has been unchecked and smooth. Just in\nthe same way the curler has to follow through, and though no doubt both\ncurler and golfer can, theoretically, check their swing the moment after\nthe stone and the ball have started, they would be most ill-advised to\nattempt to do so, since they run a grave risk of checking their swings\nbefore the stone or the ball have gone, and thus giving to their shot\nonly a fraction of the force of the swing. So the curler is strongly\nadvised to let this forward swing of his arm and body work itself out in\nthe natural follow-through. And this follow-through may express itself\nin various ways. Most curlers express it by letting themselves run or\nslide a few steps after their stone, the forward swing of the body\noverbalancing their left foot, so that they instinctively (for fear they\nshould fall down) put the right foot in front of it\u2014in other words, take\na few steps. Others again, and chiefly those who deliver the stone with\nright leg very\nstrongly bent, so that the knee touches or nearly touches the ice, have\nnot time to scramble to their feet, and usually express their\nfollow-through by falling forward on their hands on to the ice. But in\nwhatever way they conduct themselves, this little run and slide which\nsome take and the falling forward of others are the result of the\nplayer\u2019s proper and correct follow-through. He has not, at any rate,\ninterfered with or checked his swing: he has delivered his stone with\nthe force that he believed to be required.",

This \u201chandle\u201d gives a rotatory motion to the stone, so that as\nit is travelling up the ice it is also slowly revolving on its own axis,\neither from right to left or left to right, and this rotation imparts to\nit, as its initial velocity diminishes and its pace slows down, a\ncurling movement, in the manner of a break from the off or a break from\nthe leg at cricket, or, if you will, a swerve in the air, or, as in\ngolf, of a pull or a slice. Thus, though a stone on the tee may be\ncompletely guarded and covered, the player can, by imparting this\nrotatory movement to his stone, curl round the guard and reach his goal.\nMoreover, he can curl round the straight guard from either side, from\nthe leg or from the off, so that if one path is blocked by another\nguard, he may yet get access by the other. He can, too, if there is, as\noften happens, a slight bias in the ice, apply the handle opposite to\nthe direction in which the bias of the ice would deflect his shot, and\nthus keep his stone straight. Or again, by aiding the bias by the other\nhandle, he can get round a very wide obstacle indeed.\nHeaven knows that these shots so glibly recorded are not easy; but there\nis hardly a shot or a man\u0153uvre in any game which is easy. But the man\nwho aspires to be a curler at all must have a fair command of this thing\ncalled \u201chandle.\u201d He must be able to direct a shot with moderate accuracy\non the skip\u2019s besom with either out-handle or in-handle. It is not\nenough equipment for the most modest player, who is a curler at all, to\nbe able to play with one handle only. He must have a tolerable command\nof both.",

    "text": "Now, strange as it may at first appear, it is far easier to send down\na stone with in-handle or out-handle on it than to send down a perfectly\nstraight stone with no handle at all. Furthermore, the slightest frozen\nchip of ice, or minutest fragment of broom may, in passing under one\nside of the stone, impart a fortuitous and rotatory motion to it, so\nthat a stone arriving in the house with practically no curl at all upon\nit is (except in the case of a fast hard stone) a rarity. Since, then,\nit is almost bound to have some handle on it, it is wiser for the player\nto put on the handle himself intentionally and allow for its curling\ncourse. This rotatory motion of the stone is imparted to it by a very\nslight turn of the arm just before the stone leaves the hand. If the\nelbow is turned outwards, it is called \u201cout-elbow\u201d or \u201cout-handle,\u201d\nthough I am inclined to think that it is the wrist which makes the turn\n(some people say the fingers alone), the elbow merely following the\nwrist. This gives the stone a twist from right to left, and the effect\nof it is that it curls in from the right in the manner of a ball bowled\nwith leg-break. This out-handle curl is easily imparted to the stone by\nturning the handle of it, as the hand grasps it, outwards at\nright angles or thereabouts to the direction of the stone\u2019s travelling,\nand by holding the handle \u201coverhand,\u201d as it were, with the knuckles and\nback of the hand facing the ice in front. The curl is then naturally\nimparted to it, and the player will not have to think about it at all.\nIf he delivers his stone in this way his wrist, if he holds his arm\nslack, as he always should (giving the velocity to the stone only by the\nswing), will naturally and inevitably make the outward turn. And it is a\nmost important thing that the player should not think of handle at all\nwhen he delivers his stone, but leave that to develop automatically from\nthe correct delivery, since the consideration of the pace and direction\nof the stone are enough to fill the most capacious mind and tax the\nutmost of his skill. How much allowance should be made for the curl, and\nhow much the stone should be aimed to the right of where it is desired\nthat it should come to rest, is a matter which is largely left to the\njudgment of the skip, who has been observing how much curl the ice\ntakes. This differs very considerably, and depends on the condition of\nthe surface. For instance, if the ice is very slow, a stone dies\nquickly, and since the curl does not begin to take effect till the\ninitial speed has very much diminished, it will not curl for so long as\nit would on keen ice. On slow ice, in other words, the course of the\nstone is less influenced by handle. But again, the vigorous polishing of\nthe ice in front of a stone tends to keep it straight, since then the\nroughnesses of the ice, on which the rotatory motion bites, are much\ndiminished. But as a rule, after a few stones have been sent down, it is\nclear to a good skip how much handle they are taking, and he directs\naccordingly.",

For\nus, duffers and strugglers, there is a simpler method, which is to aim\nthe shot always with the curl that we naturally impart to it,\nand take more or less \u201cice\u201d as the case may be: aim it, that is to say,\ncloser to the required resting-place for the stone if the ice is taking\nbut little bias, and further from it if the ice is encouraging the\ndeflection.

    "text": "Finally, but no less importantly, with regard to sweeping. It is\nhardly too much to say that a good sweeper is almost worth his place in\na side, even though he is an indifferent player, so tremendous is the\npart which a good sweeper plays, for he is like a good field at cricket.\nHe should always start before the stone gets to him, so that by the time\nit is opposite him he is moving down the rink with it, ready to begin\noperations the moment his skip tells him. The word of command may come\nat any second, and it is often of vital importance that he should begin\ninstantly. Even skips have errors of judgment, and the skip may have not\ngiven the order to sweep soon enough. This can often be rectified by\ninstant and vigorous sweeping, and the error repaired, whereas if a\nsweeper is slow to go about his job the mistakes on the part of the skip\nmay be irremediable. All down his allotted portion of the ice the good\nsweeper will sidle along by the travelling stone, even though no order\ncomes, until he has given it into keeping of the next sweeper or of the\nskip himself. And with the same promptitude as he began to sweep must he\nstop sweeping when he hears the word \u201cUp brooms!\u201d Another yard of polish\nmay, if the skip is correct in his estimate, be the death of a winner.\nOften again it is but a question of an inch or two to turn a hog into\nthe most perfect of long guards, and this inch or two is entirely a\nmatter of sweeping. The most moribund of travellers may be coaxed over\nthe line and make an incalculable difference in the score by protecting\na winner. But \u201ca little less and what worlds away.\u201d... A shot that good\nsweeping would have made into a gem is bundled off the ice like the\nworst stone ever sent down on its degraded handle.",

Here single\nplayers compete against each other in attempting to make certain shots\nwhich are set them. Stones are put on the ice in certain given\npositions, and each competitor in turn has to try to bring off a certain\ndefinite shot. For instance, he will have to guard one stone, to promote\nanother, to get an inwick off a third, to draw a port between two\nothers, &c. It is, of course, a very high test of skill, but is\nsomewhat a Lenten or humiliating affair, since the very finest players\nseldom get as much as half-marks. It is, moreover, lacking in all the\n\u201cteam-feeling\u201d which is one of the greatest charms in match play, and is\nalso, in the present writer\u2019s humble opinion, a terribly tedious affair,\nsince after each shot, if the lying stones have been touched, they must\nbe replaced on their marked spots, and a competition of this kind, if\nthere is at all a large field, goes on rather longer than into eternity.\nAccording to the regulations drawn up by the Royal Caledonian Club there\nare nine shots to be played and a tenth is added in case of a tie. The\nnecessary stones to play on to are placed in or around the house, and\nthe competitor has then nine different shots to play.",

When riding a skeleton, the toes of\nthe boots are fitted with toothed irons, so that they can be used\ntogether as brakes, or singly, in order to make the toboggan curve in\nthe required direction. The runners of these toboggans are not\nrectangular like those on luges, but of circular shape, thus producing\nthe minimum of friction on their travelling surface.

Never will the writer\nforget one such night on the Klosters road. We had sleighed up from\nDavos, a party of friends, to Wolfgang, on one of those magical nights\nwhen no breath of wind stirred the lightest jewels of hoar-frost on the\npines, when the moon was full, and the stars burned like diamonds\naflame. All the way up, after dinner, there had been talk and laughter,\nand standing ready to go, we arranged that there should be two minutes\u2019\npause between the despatch of the toboggans, and one by one we slid off\ninto the unspeakable silence of the Alpine night. It so happened that I\nwas the last to go, and for two minutes I waited at the head of the\ntrack in a stillness that is unimaginable. When I started there was in\nall probability not a living soul within half a\nmile, and the nearest was sliding swiftly further away every moment. For\na little way the track lay open to the full blaze of the zenithed moon,\nbut soon it plunged beneath the impenetrable canopy of pines. It was\npossible to see the white glimmer of the road ahead, otherwise there was\nnothing visible. Then, with the suddenness of a curtain withdrawn, the\nblackness became a celestial and ineffable glory of close burning\nconstellations, with the full disc of the moon shining imperially among\nthem. Far below, distant and dim, I could see the lights of Klosters,\nand half-longed to reach them, in order to get out of this awful and\nburning and frozen solitude, half-longed that my travel might be\nlengthened into an eternity of wheeling stars and flying road. Sometimes\nit seemed that I was rushing headlong through space, sometimes it seemed\nthat I was stopping absolutely still, and that it was this unreal world\nof trees and road and bridges and banks that hurled itself by me, and\nthat the stars and I were the steadfast things. Once the sudden roar of\na stream over the bridge of which I passed sounded loud and menacing,\nbut in a moment that was past, and the hissing spray of frozen snow\ncoming from the bows of my toboggan was the only sound audible. And then\nthe lights of Klosters gleamed larger and nearer, and this wonderful\nswift solitude was over.",

    "text": "Some idea of the speed at which toboggans travel on the straight\nreaches of the course may be gathered from the average speed at which\nthe course can be run. It is over 1300 yards in length, and has been\ntraversed in a shade over 60 seconds! This means that the highest rate\nof speed must be well over 70 miles an hour. This on a pair of steel\nrunners, head foremost, with your face a few inches above the solid ice,\nwith nothing to check you except a small-toothed rake on the toe of each\nboot! Yet so wonderfully skilful is the construction of the run, so\ncunningly is it built to safeguard the headlong traveller, that\naccidents are very few. Two fatal ones, indeed, there have been, but of\nthese one had nothing to do with the course itself, but was owing to the\nfact that a rider started from the top before one of the\nbarriers across the course, which show that it is not open for racing,\nhad been removed. In the other, the rider ran over a bank and his\ntoboggan fell on the top of him. One of the great difficulties which the\nbuilders and managers of this run, in company with other ice-runs, have\nto contend against, is the power of the sun. It is, of course,\nabsolutely necessary that the icing of the run should be so solid that\nthere is no chance of the runner of a toboggan going through it, which\nwould naturally mean a bad spill. But it is also necessary that certain\nof the banks must have the sun blazing into them all day long, which\nwould cause them to lose ice faster than it could be made by the\nsprinkling which goes on when the sun is off them. At such points,\ntherefore, big canvas screens are put up, which shade the bank from the\ndirect rays; also tobogganing is never permitted to go on all day. It\nstarts early in the morning, when the run has been recuperated by the\nnight of frost, and is closed when, in the opinion of the management,\nthe sun has so softened the banks that there is danger of a toboggan\ncutting through the crust.",

    "text": "This charming form of the sport may be described as combined\ntobogganing, and in bobbing races teams of four enter against each\nother. The form of toboggan used is, of course, immensely larger than\nthat employed in single tobogganing, since it will hold five or six\npersons, and its construction is altogether different and most\nelaborate. It consists of a long, low platform some\n10 feet in length, and is mounted, not on one pair of runners, but on\ntwo. The pair that supports the fore part of the bobsleigh is a sort of\nbogie-truck, pivoted under the platform, and it can be turned to the\nright and left in order to direct the course of the bob round curves.\nThis turning of it is done by the captain, who sits first at the bows of\nthe sleigh, and is worked by ropes, which he holds in his hands, or by a\nwheel which controls its movements. In long runs, as on the Schatz-alp\nat Davos, the wheel is far better than the ropes, since it entails so\nmuch less strain on the hands of the steersman: on a short run the ropes\nare as good. Behind the captain sit the members of his crew in line,\nwith the loops of rope just outside the framework of the sleigh, in\nwhich they fix their heels. Last of them all sits the brakesman, at the\nstern of the sleigh, who has in his control a powerful steel-toothed\nbrake, which crosses the sleigh behind and is worked with levers. But it\nis the captain who is in command of the bob, and the brakesman and other\nmembers of the crew only perform his orders. The word \u201cbobsleigh\u201d is\nderived from the movement of leaning or \u201cbobbing\u201d forward, which is done\nby all the crew together, to get up speed or increase it. They come\nforward quickly with a jerk, and go back again slowly and steadily, and\nthis without doubt accelerates the movement of the sleigh.",

    "text": "As in all other forms of tobogganing, braking is employed to diminish\nspeed in coming to corners, where otherwise the momentum would cause the\nwhole concern to leave the track altogether. So also, just as the\nice-tobogganer inclines his body\ninwards in a similar position, the captain and crew lean to the inside\nof the track when going round a corner so as to help the toboggan round\nit, while the inclination of the front pair of runners is directed to\nthe same end. By strong leaning inwards, combined with the inclination\nof the bogie-pair of runners, quite considerable curves may be taken at\nhigh velocity without the use of the brake at all, and the consequent\nloss of speed. But all this is left to the judgment of the captain, who\nhas to decide whether by direction of the bogie-runners alone, or by\nthat in conjunction with the leaning inwards of his crew, he can safely\nnegotiate a corner without calling for the use of the brake. And the\nresponsibility is entirely in his hands. At the same time much depends\non the prompt obedience of the crew to his orders, for it is easily\npossible that a corner might have been safely coasted round if they had\nobeyed his call to lean inwards, which would spill them all if his call\nwas not immediately responded to. How great the effect of this inward\nshifting of the weight can be, if it is thoroughly carried out, may be\nguessed from Plate XXXI. In this same photograph the inward direction of\nthe front pair of runners may also be seen assisting the work of the\ncrew. And it is this \u201cteamwork,\u201d the sense of working in unison under\norders, which gives much of its charm to bobbing. Everyone\nfeels\u2014rightly\u2014that much of the success of the run depends on his\nindividual work, even though his individual work is only to lean as far\nas possible out of the bob without parting company with it\naltogether.",

As is natural,\nthe practice and ability which enable a man to play ordinary hockey with\nmoderate success are a large factor in his success when he woos the more\nelusive sister-sport; another factor, and one which is not sufficiently\nappreciated, is the strength of his skating. It is not enough to be able\nto run very swiftly on the skates: no one is an ice-hockey player of the\nlowest grade who cannot turn quickly to right or left, start quickly,\nand above all, stop quickly.

Strength, as we have seen before, is not the prime\nneed of a skater, but balance: strength, however, is a most useful\nadjunct.

And it was in this\nmanner. A round dozen of these delightful nonstops\nhad made up a hockey match. The rink where they played bounded on three\nsides by snow-banks; on the fourth, at the edge of which was one of\ntheir goals, an extremely steep descent (caused by the levelling up of\nthe ground to make the rink), about 15 feet in height, plunged into the\nsnow-covered field below. It was a very cold afternoon, and (so rightly)\nthe two gentlemen who were deputed to keep goal preferred to plunge into\nthe fray and go for the puck whenever they could catch sight of it. In\ngeneral, there were some four or five out of the twelve players on their\nfeet simultaneously: the rest were momentarily prone.

    "text": "But of these three classes, I think the confirmed and inoculated\nskier is most absolutely wedded to his sport. You will find him a rarer\nvisitor to either form of rink than is the inoculated skater or curler\nto the ski-ing slopes. It will often happen, also, that the inoculated\ncurler visits the skating-rinks, or the inoculated skater the house and\nthe hog. But the man who comes out to Switzerland in order to ski very\nseldom visits either. For various and intricate as are the man\u0153uvres\nwhich the expert can perform on skates, and various as are the movements\nwhich the expert can cause his curling-stones to perform, there is at\nthe command of the skier a greater expanse of conquerable territory. Not\nonly has he his figures, so to speak, to cut on the snow-fields, his\nTelemark and Christiania swings, and his stemming turns, which\ncorrespond roughly to the threes and rockers and change of edge in the\nskater\u2019s art, and the outwicks and inwicks of the curler, but he has his\ntravel over the snows for travel\u2019s sake: he is an artist in climbing,\nand the whole horizon (omitting such mountain peaks as the Matterhorn or\nthe Aiguilles) are part of his rink, which reaches, broadly speaking,\nwherever there is snow. And some part of his rink, however bad the\nweather, is pretty certain to\nbe in order. The skater\u2019s rink may be (as has been known within the\nmemory of man to happen) an inglorious series of pools, or have vanished\nentirely under a covering of snow, and similarly, the curler\u2019s rink is\noccasionally found to resemble a sort of cold wet toffee. But the\nskier\u2019s rink is hardly ever altogether impracticable, and he can both\ntravel and in his travelling cut his figures. Hardly ever, though he may\nhave to go far to get it, will he fail, except when a severe fall of\nsnow is actually going on, to find slopes on which he can at any rate\n\u201cplay about.\u201d Consider also the infinite variety of his tumbles. His\nfalls are more complicated, have more pleasing uncertainty about them,\nthan those which any skater can indulge in. Also they hurt far less.\nThere are few skaters who can manage to fall more than about half a\ndozen times a day, unless they are exceptionally young, or, as the\ninquests say, very \u201cwell nourished,\u201d and yet continue their practice\nwith undiminished vigour. But there are few skiers, old or young, lean\nor otherwise, who will be the least discouraged by twice that number of\ntumbles.",

    "text": "Here, too, is another reason for the fidelity of the skier to his\nsport. It yields him, if he is a novice, a quicker dividend of pleasure\nthan skating yields to the beginner, or curling to the curler. After a\nweek\u2019s practice, starting from the beginning, the skater will scarcely\nyet have felt himself firmly travelling on an outside edge, which, when\nhe has accomplished it, is after all only the beginning of further\ntrouble, while the curler, after the same lapse of time, will not have\nbegun to deliver his stones with the most distant approach to what could\npossibly be called accuracy. But the\nskier will already be cognisant of the rapture of sliding swiftly\ndownhill on the hissing snow, and though the \u201cfrequent fall\u201d awaits him,\nhe will have experienced a genuine taste of the authentic joy. He will,\ntoo, have climbed high and heavenwards, have seen new horizons spread\nthemselves, have seen further peaks in the magic of the Alpine air and\nsunshine rear their austere heads. Stumblingly, perhaps, he will have\npenetrated into new valleys among the \u201choly hills,\u201d and felt the\nsurprise and sting of exploration. He will also, if he has devoted\nhimself to the tricks\u2014the skating-figures of his art\u2014be appreciably\nnearer the achievement of stemming turns than the skater will be to the\naccomplishment of a simple three, or the curler to the hope of coming\ninto the house round a guard. Thus, if anyone who can get three weeks in\nSwitzerland, without solid hope of getting more in subsequent years,\nwere to ask how, being active of body, he could get the maximum of\nenjoyment out of those three weeks, I should unhesitatingly advise him\nto practise ski-ing, though, should he have a reasonable prospect of\ncoming out in future years, I should just as unhesitatingly recommend\nhim to persevere for a little while, anyhow, with his skates, or stick\nto the curling-rink if he desires a less hazardous sport. But if he has\na short holiday, without reasonable prospects of coming out again, I\nthink if he is young and active he will get more fun in a short time if\nhe betakes himself to the skis. Moreover, whatever resort he honours\nwith his presence, he is certain to find there fair ski-ing slopes,\nespecially in unfavourable weather, and in the vast majority of cases,\nexcellent ones. Indeed, if he only anticipates one visit to\nSwitzerland, he will find everywhere slopes that will be for him\nexcellent.",

    "text": "Without going into any excessive details with regard to his\nequipment, certain facts about it must be broadly stated. The ski\nitself, as anyone seeking those altitudes in winter is probably aware,\nis a long narrow slip of wood turned up at the bows and fastened to his\nfoot. It is smooth on the under-surface, thicker under the place where\nhis foot comes than elsewhere, and should have a shallow groove running\nup the middle of it. In length it should be a few inches shorter than\nits owner if he stands with his arms outstretched above his head. In\nother words, a man 6 feet high will want a ski about 7 feet long. This\nis only a rough-and-ready rule, and if the skier arrives at his Alpine\nresort with\nthe intention merely of hiring skis, he should not choose them shorter\nthan this. It is easier to travel on skis that are too long than on\nthose which are too short. But, however long the skis are, they cannot\nbe too narrow. Mr. Caulfield (an adept and authority) lays down that at\nthe narrowest part (i.e. where the foot rests) they should\nnever be more than 2\u00be inches in breadth. Instantly the novice will\nexclaim that his boot at the ball of the foot is broader than that, and\nthat his boot will project beyond the skis. He is perfectly right: it\nwill. But Mr. Caulfield is right too. He should also see that the grain\nof the ski lies longitudinally, and that the ski itself is slightly\narched, the top of the arch lying underneath the wearer\u2019s foot. If the\nski is quite flat, it will bend downwards in soft snow under the weight\nand impede the going. These directions, which sound slightly advanced\nfor him who has never seen a ski at all, are really most elementary. No\nbeginner should attempt to ski on contraptions that do not fulfil all\nthese requirements. He might as well begin learning to walk in boots\nthat are not adapted for ordinary wear.",

    "text": "Of the actual equipment (i.e. of tools necessary for ski-ing\nat all) the next matter is sticks. Of these the skier should always\ncarry two, by the help of which he makes a supplementary punting\nmovement when going along the level or up gentle slopes; while on a\nsteeper upward slope he leans on them to distribute his weight, and thus\nprevent back-slipping of his skis. They should therefore be strong and\nlight, and made of cane. They terminate at their lower end in sharp\nsteel points, and some few inches above those points they should be\nfitted with a light circular disc of wicker-work which prevents them\nsinking into the snow. Otherwise the\nholder, leaning on them, would merely be plunged up to his shoulders in\nsoft drifts, which would not serve his purpose. They also help to steady\nhim, in the manner of an ice-axe, when climbing very steep slopes or\nwhen zigzagging, and should be at least shoulder high. Coming downhill\nthe beginner, when the pace grows too fast for his liking, is accustomed\nto lean heavily on them, grasping them together in both hands and making\nof them a brake to his headlong career. This man\u0153uvre is called\n\u201cstick-riding,\u201d and is unanimously discouraged by all experts, however\ndivergent may be their views on the subject of bindings. Later, when the\nbeginner is joining himself to these austere folk, he will cease to\nstick-ride, and make stemming-curves and Telemarks and\nChristiania-swings instead. But as long as the world goes round, and the\nforce of gravity continues to exercise its accelerating force, so long,\nwhatever the experts may teach, shall we see the beginner descending a\nslope, bending low, with eyes starting out of his head in pleasing\nterror, and leaning heavily on his conjoined sticks. It is safe also to\nassert that the austere experts did exactly the same when, in the dark\nages, they were starting on their glorious careers. Therefore, by all\nmeans, let the beginner select strong sticks. Any anchor, however\nillegitimate, is better than an anchor that snaps in half. For the\ncounsels of perfection are only appreciated when the possibility, not of\nperfection, but of moderate skill, begins to dawn on the rosy heights.\nTill then, O fellow-tyro and novice, gaily descend slopes that terrify\nand unnerve you, conscious that, when the terror becomes unbearable, you\ncan lean heavily on your sticks and check your mad\ncareer. This is profoundly immoral advice, but the knowledge that you\nhave strong sticks in your hands will enable you to contemplate and thus\nimperfectly negotiate these places in a straight direct line. You will\nknow what it feels like to face straight down these abominable\nprecipices, and will have gained a sensation. But without the knowledge\nthat you held in your hands a powerful instrument of retardation you\nwould, very likely, have never gained the sensation at all. This is a\ncounsel of imperfection, and if you design to be a first-rate skier you\nwill not follow it. But if you have, as in our hypothetical case, only a\nfew weeks in these uplands, without prospect of more, launch yourself\nwith your strong sticks on a blood-curdling incline, see what it feels\nlike, and, when your nerves cannot bear it, lean heavily on both\nsticks.",

    "text": "But the moment we progress a little further than the hypothetical\ncase of the man who for one winter has three weeks of Switzerland in\nfront of him, and then, as far as seems probable, no more Switzerland at\nall, the joys of the skier increase in a quickly ascending scale. Just\nas the skater in the English style finds that the threes and the rockers\nand the counters that he has so painfully learned are not only\ndelightful in themselves, but help him towards qualifying as a good\nskater in the combined figures, and just as the Continental skater finds\nthat those same figures assist him to produce a first-rate programme in\nfree-skating, so also does the skier who on easy slopes has made himself\nacquainted with the various turns, find that his education there vastly\nincreases his enjoyment in and proficiency at the glorious\nexcursions which are all to be made on his immense rink. Slopes and\ndescents that would be impracticable for him to descend if he had not\nlearned the tricks, the figures of his sport, are easy and pleasurable\nif he can make his Telemark, his Christiania, his stemming turns, and\nnot only do they become practicable, but his negotiation of these slopes\nbecomes an artistic performance instead of being a terrified and\nstick-riding descent, just as to make a vol-plan\u00e9 from the skies is a\nbeautiful feat, whereas to slide down a rope merely hurts the hands. In\nthe same way, the ascents, which were a mere succession of stumblings\nand misdirected efforts, and sweatings unspeakable, lose their\narduousness when he has learned how to climb steep slopes with the\nminimum of exertion. All his practice with other elementary enthusiasts\nin the field behind the hotel (or in front of it)\u2014there is everywhere\nsome such field at a suitably steep angle\u2014works into what must always be\nin ski-ing, the main object of the sport, which is to be able to\ntraverse the snows and make mid-winter expeditions over the high\nenchanted country, which is otherwise inaccessible. For on skis you can\nwith ease climb slopes which are absolutely impossible to the\npedestrian, since the skier goes unsinking over soft snow and drifts\nthat would engulf the man in boots as in a frozen quicksand; while in\ndescents over such places the difference is only emphasised. A\nski-runner will in a few minutes descend, thrilled with the joy of a\nmovement that really resembles flying, places which at the least take\nthe pedestrian hours of plunging labour. He is indifferent as to the\ndepths of snow, since he is only concerned with an inch or two of it,\nand rapturously descends a\nthousand feet, while a walker is cursing at the first hundred of them.\nBut the ski-runner\u2019s enjoyment and speed, both in the climb and in the\ndescent, are vastly increased if he has learned the elements of his art.\nThereby he saves effort, saves time, saves tumbles, and saves temper; at\nthe end of a run his mental bank is rich with pleasure, whereas a man\nwho has not taken the trouble to learn these tricks of the trade comes\nin with a debit balance, so to speak, mis-spent labour, unnecessary\nfalls, and loss of time and temper. He must learn the elements of\nclimbing, of turning, and of braking, not by heavily leaning on his\nstrong poles, but by the far simpler and less tiring methods of using\nhis skis to do the braking for him.",

Each ski just avoids treading on the heel\nof the other, and clears it by an inch or two, so that the track left\nresembles the outline of a piece of herring-bone brickwork. There is the\nsame resemblance in the name of this man\u0153uvre, since it is called\nherring-boning. Then once more the climber varies his style of progress,\nfor here the slope is exceedingly steep, and he has come to a narrow\ngully, where his zig-zags\nwould have to be very short, and instead of interspersing every few\nsteps with a kick-turn he stands sideways to the slope and puts down one\nfoot horizontally across it and brings the other close up to and\nparallel with it. Then he steps sideways again with the first foot, and\nrepeats the man\u0153uvre. Twenty or thirty paces of this sort bring him to\nthe top of his gully, and he stops a moment looking over the view which\nhis climb has opened out to him. (That also is a frequently-practised\nski-ing man\u0153uvre and quite easy. The view-trick is indulged in after a\nsteep bit of climbing, and is dictated by a love of scenery combined\nwith the need of getting your breath again.)",

Sometimes,\nperhaps, one who has climbed into the gully out of which the first\nexpert has disappeared, will stand for a moment facing downhill, and\nthen launch himself on a perfectly straight course. He will be standing\nupright, but leaning forward, which is not a contradiction in terms, if\nthis phrase is considered. In other words, his whole head, body, and\nlegs will be inclined a little forward, but he will also be upright\nbecause there is no bend in his knees or hips or neck. In other words,\nhe will be standing at right angles to the slope, though leaning\nforward. His skis will be quite close together, so that they make but\none track in the snow, and his right foot probably will be a few inches\nin front of his left. His arms will be a little raised, so that his\nsticks, which swing pendulum-like from his hands, do not touch the snow,\nand his descent is that of a stooping hawk. A spray of fine snow rises\nround the toes of his skis, like the feather of water round the bows of\nsome lightning-speeded boat. A moment ago he was but a speck high up on\nthe mountain-side, the next he is but a speck at the end of the slope\nbelow. If not so fortunate, he is somewhere in the middle of that\nsudden-spouting billow of snow that mars the smooth whiteness of the\nhill. But in any case, the beginner has seen a specimen of ordinary\nstraight-running, the figure upright and inclined forward, the skis\nclose together, with sinecure for the sticks. And if our beginner\u2019s\ncourage is high, he will instantly attempt, from the more gradual slope\non which he stands, to do the same. Probably, if he remembers to ape\nthis flying Mercury in the points mentioned, he will progress quite a\nconsiderable number of yards at his sedater speed without falling. Then\na wild panic will seize him at the thought that his pace is steadily\nincreasing, and that he has not the slightest idea how to check it. That\nthought alone will most likely be sufficient so to unsteady him that he\nwill instantly fall down and find that he has grasped one method,\nanyhow, of stopping. He may then employ the few moments\u2019 pause that\ninvariably succeed a tumble to observing whether, from the tracks his\nskis have left, he has kept his feet together. If he has, he may feel\njustifiably pleased with himself, but must not be discouraged if the\ntracks resemble the old broad gauge of the Great Western Railway.",

Then he makes a twist of his shoulders and\nbody towards the right, exactly as if he was cutting a three-turn on\nskates, and, lo, he has turned round in exactly the same manner as in\nthe Telemark. He does not, it is true, continue the back-edge downhill,\nbut halts on the cusp, as it were, facing uphill, as at the end of the\nTelemark swing. But what he has done is to make a Christiania swing,\nwith the foot towards the direction of his turn advanced instead of the\nopposite foot, as in the Telemark. But the effect is the same: he has\nstopped in the middle of a swift downward descent without falling down\nor braking. Probably, to touch for a moment on minuti\u00e6, he has\nmade his Christiania on a hard and ice-crusted place, whereas the\nTelemarker has selected a spot of soft snow for his performance. So, if\nthe beginner is tempted to try this last man\u0153uvre, he is advised to look\nout for an icy patch where the sun has thawed the surface of the snow,\nwhich has subsequently frozen again. On arriving at such a patch, he\nwill probably conclude (as our American cousins say) to reserve the\nChristiania for another day.",

But for as many years as he\nis active of body, he will gain in facility in accomplishing these\nthings, and probably no skier has ever reached anything approaching\nperfection, any more than any skater has attained that undesirable goal.\nIt is advisedly that I say \u201cundesirable,\u201d since to our limited skill it\nseems to me that half the fun of any sport would be subtracted if we\ncould possibly become perfect in it. But, on the other hand, the skier,\nif he is at all master of his limbs, will more easily attain that\nmoderate degree of excellence which will enable him to join comfortably\nand easily in these climbs and expeditions which are the joy of\nski-running, than he would attain the excellence required of a member of\na fair combined figure in skating or of a player in a respectable\ncurling team. But whereas in skating and curling he can only spoil the\namusement of other people (or perhaps, if they are humorously inclined,\nadd to it), he incurs grave danger if he attempts to go on arduous\nski-ing expeditions without having got some facility in the easier\nski-ing figures, such as the kick-turn on his ascents and the\nstemming-turn on his descents. Odd as it may appear, everyone has not\nthe nerve to fall down in time, in case a sudden obstacle appears in\nfront of him, or, which is perhaps worse, a sudden absence of anything\nat all, in the guise of a precipice. But a man who can, with the ease of\nhabit, make a stemming-turn or, better still, both of the other turns,\ncan stop when he chooses. To attain such moderate skill is not at all\na\ndifficult matter, but without it, only a lunatic would join any long\nexpedition. If he is incapable of climbing slopes except with an\ninfinite degree of slipping and stumbling, he is a nuisance to his\ncompanions; while if in the descents he is incapable of any turn, he\nmay, if he has the nerve to fall down promptly, be only a worse\nnuisance; but if he has not, he may become a source of much danger to\nhimself.",

Outside, on the\nboot, is a frozen spray of snow, inside is the moisture of the foot\nasking, positively demanding, to be frozen also. The tightness of the\nboot and stocking further impedes the surface-circulation, and a\nfrost-bitten foot is very likely the response to this\nwell-meant protection of it. Instead, the boot should be so large that\nit can easily accommodate two layers of woollen stuff loosely.

    "text": "The glad word is passed round the hotel one evening that some famous\nski-jumper has arrived and will give an exhibition next day; and next\nday, accordingly, you trudge out on to the slope where the jump has been\nerected. This is a long steep hillside, and the platform for the jump\nhas been put up some hundred yards from the top of it. It is a champion\njumper who has arrived, and the apparatus is on the big scale. Out from\nthe slope of the hill is this platform, built in the manner of a dormer\nwindow in a house-roof or a header-board above a pool. It is made of\nwooden planks supported on posts, and covered with a layer of\ndown-trodden snow. It is some 5 yards or so in length, 5 or 6 feet\nbroad, and the edge of it is some 6 feet perpendicularly above the slope\nat its base. At the corners of it, to guide the jumper who approaches\nit, are\nboughs of fir stuck into the snow, or flags. Above it the slope is of\nmoderate steepness, sufficient, anyhow, for a skier to get up a\nconsiderable speed when running straight down towards it from above;\nbelow the hillside is considerably steeper, and continues at a steep\nangle for two or three hundred yards. Both above and below the platform\nthe snow is being industriously trodden down by those engaged on the\npreparations, so as to make a smooth firm run for the jumper before he\ngets to his platform, and a smooth firm landing-place after his flight\nthrough the air. The reason of this is that it is absolutely essential\nthat the jumper should have no check when he touches ground again after\nhis flight: if he landed in soft or deep snow he would quite certainly\nhave a bad fall. But with hard smooth snow to land on there is no such\ncheck, and on landing he continues his course at high speed straight\ndown the hill. It is also extremely important for him to land on a steep\nslope; for if the slope was but gentle, the shock of coming in contact\nwith it from such a height would clearly be extremely severe, and broken\nbones would undoubtedly result. But the steep slope lends itself to the\npace he is going and the height from which he comes, and, as it were,\ncontinues his flight on the ground. Also, the steeper the slope is, the\nlonger obviously will the jump be, as measured from the platform to the\npoint where he first lands.",

On each side of the course stretch out\nlines of spectators, and a hundred yards\nabove the jumper is standing talking to friends and seeming positively\nto enjoy what lies in front of him. Then the word is given, and,\nsteadying himself on his two sticks he points his skis straight down\ntowards the jump. He shoves off with his sticks, leaving them standing\nin the snow (for no jumper uses sticks when he jumps, which would be\nhighly dangerous), and at swiftly accelerating speed glides down the\nslope. As he approaches the jumping-platform he crouches low, and just\nas he traverses it he springs upwards and forwards into the air. High\nabove your head, a veritable flying man, he soars, with all the impetus\nthat his run and his spring have given him. For a hundred feet or more\nhe continues this amazing flight in a superb curve, and you wait\nbreathless, scarcely able to believe that when he touches the ground\nagain at that pace and from that height there will be anything but a\nheap of broken bones there. But he alights without shock or the least\nappearance of unsteadiness, and simultaneously, it appears, he is\nalready another hundred feet down the slope, going like an arrow. Then\ncomes perhaps the most astounding feat of all: he suddenly kneels, and\nin a moment has swung round with a Telemark, and has come to rest,\nfacing up the hillside over which he has flown and skimmed. And then\nthis extraordinary young man (he is usually rather young) will climb his\nslope again and instantly repeat the process, in evident enjoyment, or,\nmore remarkable yet, he will get hold of another like himself, and they\nwill take their jump hand-in-hand, let go of each other on landing, and\nTelemark, one to the right the other to the left!",

    "text": "us that if the beginner starts with small jumps, and is careful to do\neverything correctly and in the proper style from the beginning, he will\nnot find it either a difficult or dangerous pursuit. But he must be\ncareful to make his movements (his crouch, his spring, his angle in the\nair, the levelness of his skis as he alights, &c.) with accuracy and\ncorrect timing; while it is not less important that the jump itself\nshould be properly constructed and the slopes that lead to and from it\nbe of suitable steepness. Indeed, what appears to the ignorant onlooker\nthe most hazardous part of the whole affair, namely, the landing on a\nvery steep slope, is safe only if the slope is steep, and the real\nobstacle that lies in the way of most men taking up jumping as a sport,\nis not that it is dangerous so much as that their nerves tell them that\nit must be, and refuse to make the crouch and spring (the s\u00e4ts,\nas the Norwegians call it) with vigour and confidence, even if they can\nmaster their nerves so far as to let themselves run down on to the\nplatform at all. But having once reached the platform, the spring must\nbe made: otherwise the would-be jumper will merely flow stickily, so to\nspeak, over the edge, bury the toes of his skis in the snow, and\ncertainly have a bad fall. But, indeed, the nerves must be in good\ncondition, for the platform, approaching it from above, looks exactly\nlike a cliff\u2019s edge, and, jutting out as it does from the slope, it\nentirely conceals the slope below it: your eye tells you that you are\nmerely leaping over the end of all things. But if, after considering the\nquestion, you decide, as most people do, that you will not begin jumping\nthis season, you have only to repeat that prudent resolution for a few\nmore seasons, and then you will be\nable to tell yourself and everybody else that it is no use trying to\nlearn to jump unless you begin it quite as a boy. This does not really\nhappen to be the case; but it is one of those excuses that are always\ngranted acceptance, and, having firmly established it in your own mind,\nyour nipped ambition will cease to worry you any more.",

For this it is necessary to secure the co-operation of a\nhorse, and fit him with long reins or ropes, which you hold one in each\nhand, and stand behind the horse out of the way of his heels. He is\nlightly harnessed, and from his collar passes a long leather loop of\nrein, which passes round the ski-jorer\u2019s body. You then encourage your\nhorse to proceed, and if he is good enough to do so, he will naturally\npull you along on your skis by this loop of rein from his collar. It is\na fascinating pursuit to watch, and can be practised over a frozen lake\nor along the down-trodden snow of roads. Especially in the Engadine you\nwill hear the sound of bells, and observe a horse trotting or cantering\nbriskly on the road, followed at a yard or two distance by an upright\nfigure that glides along after him, a charioteer with only his skis as\nchariot.

    "text": "Of late years the number of the English\nand other nations who annually go to spend a portion at any rate of the\nwinter at some High Alpine resort has enormously increased, and in\nconsequence every year fresh hotels are opened in valleys which hitherto\nhave hybernated like dormice beneath their snow-laden roofs, during the\nmonths of short days. But it is by no means every high-perched hotel\nthat is suitable as a centre for winter sports, for there are several\nconditions to be considered. In the first place, such a spot must be\nsufficiently high up to make it probable that there will be fairly\ncontinuous frosts there throughout the winter, and this again depends\nnot only on height but also on aspect. As regards height you cannot\nreasonably depend on getting this continuity of frost (allowing for\nreasonable breaks) under the height of round about 4000 feet, especially\nif the place in question is to enjoy long hours of sun. True, an\nexceptionally severe winter may come, and the strictness of the binding\nof the frost may hold, week after week, at a much lower altitude, but it\nis natural that the holiday-maker, who has only a week or two abroad and\nwants during all his hours of daylight to be employed in sliding\nmovements, should wish to be fairly safe to find the conditions\nsuitable, and he has, obviously, a better chance of finding them if\nhe goes high. But there are several places considerably below this\n4000-foot level, such as Grindelwald, which lies in a very cold valley,\nwhere he may in an average year find himself unhampered and rendered\nidle by thaws, and it is wonderful how continuous frost is at\nGrindelwald. But there both skating-rink and curling-rink are, all day\nlong at midwinter, entirely in the shade, for the sun does not rise high\nenough at noon to look over the great barrier of rock that lies to the\nsouth of it. That protection, of course, preserves for the place its\nexcellent ice, whereas if, as at other winter resorts, it basked in the\nsun all day, the rink would speedily be metamorphosed into a degraded\nglue with discouraging pools interspersed. But if you go to greater\nheights, you can combine the pleasures of skating with those of sitting\nin the sun, and that to this writer is a remarkably charming\ncombination. But in order to enjoy that you must have greater height\nthan is possessed by Grindelwald, and a place like Montana, where the\nsun is on the rink by nine in the morning, and continues to beat down on\nit till somewhere about five in the afternoon, would see its ice and\nsnow disappear into slush and torrents of water were it not perched\nnearly 5000 feet above sea-level. St. Moritz and M\u00fcrren are throned\nhigher yet, and it has to be a very warm winter indeed which will cause\na general thaw at such places. And there is nothing more irritating than\nto have gone to some comparatively low place and find that day after day\ngoes by in melting mood, and at the same time to know that a thousand\nfeet higher up ideal conditions are being experienced.",

It is part of the essence of his sport that he climbs for it,\nwhereas skaters and curlers demand their playgrounds at the door and no\nclimbing at all. Thus the high valley leading across from Montreux in\nthe Rhone valley to Spiez by the Lake of Thun is, though its highest\nvillages and hotels are below 4000 feet, ideal for the skier, since it\nhas on each side of it lofty hills which are rich in good slopes. But\nfor the others, skaters, curlers, and tobogganers alike, it is important\nthat the frost should hold in the immediate vicinity of their hotels.\nThey do not seek their various joys on the tops of neighbouring\nmountains.",

Even\nthere, of course, you cannot be safe against thaws, and the deplorable\nseries of days known as the winter of 1911-1912, when thaw succeeded\nthaw at almost all Swiss resorts, taught us all that the malice of\nclimate is infinite and incalculable, and the summer of 1912, here in\nEngland, where the general temperature was about the same as that of the\nprevious winter in Switzerland, repeated the same lesson.

    "text": "A second consideration is wind. It would be no use at all to spend\nthe winter on a mountain-top: what is necessary is a\nhigh sheltered valley, like that of Davos or St. Moritz, or a high\nsheltered shelf on the mountain-side, like Villars or M\u00fcrren. To be able\nto skate at all, it is necessary that the day should be practically\nwindless, and quite a gentle breeze spoils it altogether. Moreover, even\ngentle breezes are currents of moving air above or below freezing-point.\nIf they are above freezing-point they spell ruin, for they melt both\nsnow and ice with amazing swiftness; if they are below freezing-point\nthey feel quite intolerably cold. Therefore, all winter places should be\nscreened from the wind on the north and east, so that, if such airs are\nastir, they pass over the valley in which you are, and their icy blasts\nare unfelt. It does not matter so much whether the valley is screened\nfrom southerly winds, for this blowing of a southerly wind means in\nitself that warm currents of air are coming up from the Mediterranean,\nand as long as that lasts there must be more or less of a thaw, and a\nscreen to the south almost necessarily implies a cutting off of the sun.\nThis southerly wind, so justly abhorred by all altitudinists, is\ngenerally known as the f\u00f6hn wind. Philologists may try to\ninterest us in it by telling us that the word is derived from the Latin\nfavonius, or south wind, but when the f\u00f6hn blows you\nare not the least consoled by knowing its derivation: you only wish it\nhad another destination. It brings clouds, mists, sleet, and even rain,\nall undesirable aliens, into our sunny valleys.",

    "text": "So much, then, for the two main conditions\u2014sun (for those who like\nit) and absence of wind for everybody. And the next prime essential is a\ngood rink, for out of every hundred people who come\nout in the winter, it is safe to say that at least eighty either skate\nor curl. And not only is a good skating-rink necessary, but good skaters\nalso, for the encouragement and instruction of the learner, and, we may\nadd, the mutual admiration of each other. But it is extraordinary how a\ngood rink seems to breed skaters: sooner or later (usually sooner) good\nskaters are attracted to it, like flies to honey, though we hope they do\nnot stick in it, and other mere beginners rapidly develop into sound\nperformers. The Davos rink developed skaters thus, and more recently the\nimmense rink at Villars has brought to birth a whole fresh school of\nEnglish skating. The writer is tempted to be anecdotal. Not more than\nsix or seven years ago he first went there and found that the only\nskating-rink was one flooded lawn-tennis court. On it the most\naccomplished skater in the place was instructing and demonstrating to\ntwo pupils. She was showing them the change of edge, and as, perhaps a\nlittle falteringly, she passed from one edge to the other she\nproclaimed: \u201cThe change from the outside edge to the inside is possible,\nbut the change from the inside to the outside is impossible.\u201d Indeed\nthat would save an infinity of trouble to many of us, if we thought it\nwas strictly true. But Villars made up its mind otherwise, and nowadays\nthe great rink, which would hold hundreds of lawn-tennis courts, holds\nhundreds of skaters also who demonstrate the falsity of that sublime\npronouncement.",

    "text": "Now ice varies enormously, not only in smoothness or roughness of\nsurface, but in texture and in hardness, and without doubt the\npleasantest and at the same time the easiest ice to skate on is\nthat which has been frozen at temperatures not unreasonably low. Should\nthe thermometer have stood all night at zero or below, the ice made\nunder that benumbing influence will be both very hard and rather\nbrittle; whereas if the rink had basked in a mellow moonlight of say 10\nor 15 degrees of frost, the ice, though perfectly solid and dry, will be\nfar kinder to the skate blade and lend itself more amenably to the\nedges. Indeed, after a very cold night, the ice is absolutely\nunskateable on until the sun has relaxed its adamantine rigidity; the\nedges of the skate will not bite. This appears to be due to the amazing\nfact, not generally known, that the skate actually moves over a thin\nlayer of water, which its passage, its weight and friction causes to be\nmomentarily produced. This transient, minute and local thaw (which\ninstantaneously ceases in the wake of the skate) does not take place\nwhen the temperature is abnormally cold, and, in consequence, the skate,\ninstead of travelling smoothly and firmly, cannot be prevented from\nskidding on the marble-like and uncuttable surface, and even when the\nsun has to some extent mitigated this hardness, the ice tends to be\nbrittle and unkind. Thus, since in very high places there are recorded a\nlarge number of very low temperatures, the skater will probably find\npleasanter ice at lower altitudes. Much, of course, depends on the\nmaking of it, and the whole question perhaps may be regarded as\ntrifling, but in the writer\u2019s opinion the resorts at which, as a rule,\nvery low temperatures do not occur, yield the greatest abundance of\njolly ice. On the other hand, the higher the place, the greater is the\nprobability of immunity from thaws.",

Below it the hillside tumbles\nswiftly away into the Rhone valley, and opposite is spread an entrancing\npanorama. The Dent du Midi, one of the most distinguished of\nmountain-forms, dominates the nearer distance; behind, much closer than\nat Montana, rise the prodigious aiguilles of Mont Blanc. If you walk but\nfor ten minutes either up or down from Villars towards the east, a gap\nopens out, and you shall see the most part of the Chamounix range, and\nthe vast dome of Mont Blanc itself. Magical are the wonders of cloudland\nspread out before you in the Rhone valley below. Sometimes an ocean of\ncloud, solid as if made of grey marble, and to all appearance as level\nas the sea, is spread from the promontories a little below where Villars\nstands straight across to the hills on the far side of the valley. It\nseems as if some cloud-boat would put out from behind a cape opposite\nand glide across this grey sea. Or again, the valley will be full of\ncloud in form of breaking waves, and tossing crests throw themselves\nagainst the hillsides and are shattered into wreaths of cloud-spray. No\nboat could live in so turbulent a water. Then, as the sun declines to\nits setting, rosy beams of fire pierce this wonderful sea, and it is\nshot with flame, and lit from within by a glow that baffles all\nlanguage. On another day and for many days together not a\nspeck of mist or shred of cloud hangs above the valley, and it is mapped\nout at your feet 2000 feet down and half a dozen miles away with the\nclearness of etching. And sometimes, I am sorry to say, when the weather\nis behaving morosely, the cloud comes up from the valley and envelops\nVillars itself. Then we take our skis or toboggan and flee up the\nhillsides through the pine-woods, all encrusted with the miracle of\nhoar-frost, into the unobscured sunshine that lies like a benediction on\nthe heights of the dazzling Chamossaire.",

The ski-ing also is much better there than at\nthat place. St. Moritz and all these other smaller centres are fortunate\nin the number of hours of sun that they enjoy: they are less fortunate\nin the wind that rather frequently blows up from the Maloja pass, a\nchilly and disconcerting current of air that not very infrequently\nstarts to blow shortly after mid-day. But there is probably no place in\nSwitzerland which enjoys a larger proportion of perfect winter days, and\nin none are the rinks more carefully made and preserved. It was one of\nthe earliest places in which the pursuit of winter sport began to\ndevelop, and from the earliest days the St. Moritz school of English\nskating was renowned for the strictness of its requirements. Of late\nyears the International style has greatly developed there, owing\nprobably to the very large number of German visitors who annually go\nthere. But there is enough ice for everybody, since many of the hotels\nhave private skating-rinks of their own, and there is no reason why the\ntwo schools should not flourish side by side. Just round about St.\nMoritz itself there is not any very extraordinary display of Alpine\nscenery, for the larger peaks are not visible therefrom. But there are,\nin addition to the winter sports already mentioned, innumerable\nexcursions to be made, and the lake-skating, when the chronology of\nsnow-fall and frost is propitious, is a tremendous though usually a\nshort-lived attraction. The journey from England can be luxuriously made\nin the Engadine express, which reaches St. Moritz in the middle of the\nday after which the voyager has left London.",

Of the latter there is the excellent Klosters road for\nluges and skeletons, which leads from the hills above Davos down to the\nvillage of Klosters, where tobogganists find a train neatly drawn up\nclose to the end of their run, in which they can return to Davos, if\nthey will, or to Wolfgang again to make another descent. For this is no\naffair of a few hundred yards: the course is several miles in length.\nLately a first-rate bob-run has been constructed from the Schatz-alp\ndown into Davos: this is served by an electric railway for the ascent.\nJust below Davos, on the level land at the basin of the valley, lie the\nskating-rinks, three in number, an enormous public rink, the rink\nconstructed by the English for purposes of English skating, and the\ncurling-rink. Here all manner of important competitions are held:\nEuropean championships in the International style, speed skating\ncompetitions round the circumference of the large rink, and for English\nskaters the annual Davos bowl. Indeed, Davos has had more to do with the\nformation of the modern school of English skating, especially in the\nmatter of combined figures, executed large and fast, than any other\nplace, and there is scarcely a single skater of any eminence in this\nstyle who has not \u201cstudied,\u201d so to speak, at Davos. Usually the ice is\nof very good quality, but a better surface would probably be more often\nattained if the management would resort to sprinkling more, instead of\nletting a\nflood make ice for several days\u2019 use. Above the town is a lake of\nconsiderable extent, on which occasional skating can be had. But a\ncommoner phenomenon than the skater on that lake are the horse-drawn\nsledges which are loaded with solid blocks of ice sawn out of the frozen\nsurface and taken away to make puddings with instead of figures on.

For years the Boss family, who own the\nBear Hotel, have studied this intricate and delicate question, and their\nmethods are beyond doubt productive of the best possible ice.\nGrindelwald, it is true, is not liable to exceedingly low temperatures,\nand thus the ice does not often become of that very hard and brittle\nquality which results therefrom; but, though the Bosses have not had to\ncontrive how to deal with these unpleasant conditions, they must be\nconsidered the parents of the school of scientific ice-production.\nOriginally Grindelwald was exclusively of the English school of skating,\nbut it has now passed into International tutelage. Indeed there was\nhardly room for two schools; for excellent as is the quality of the ice,\nit is certainly defective in area, and the rinks should be increased in\nsize or number, for even the Bear rink, which is the largest there, is\nbut of very moderate extent, and cannot hold many skaters in comfort.\nThere are curling-rinks of the same superlative quality of ice, good\nroad toboggan-runs, both for luges and the bob-sleigh, while in every\ndirection almost (except that of the Eiger precipice) there are\nadmirable ski-ing runs.

It is reached by a\nmountain-railway from Bex on the main line, and has an altitude of 4200\nfeet. Climatically it is absolutely ideal in a decently cold winter, and\nthe big hills which shield it to the north and east afford several very\ngood ski-ing expeditions. It has not, however, from a skier\u2019s point of\nview, the limitless scope of Davos, and it is in the main as a centre of\nEnglish skating that it has become so popular and widely known. The rink\nis in extent second only to the public rink at Davos, being about 17,000\nmetres in extent, and is maintained on the principles of ice-making\nwhich have come from Grindelwald. But at Villars the whole expanse of\nthe rink lies in the blaze of the sun, and, as at Davos, there is a\nrestaurant immediately adjoining. Of this big ice-surface a certain\npart, of adequate size for practice and combined figures, is reserved\nfor those who have passed the National Skating Association\u2019s Third Test,\nor the lower of the two Villars tests. This, then, forms a club-rink for\nEnglish skating, which is the only school that at present exists at\nVillars. There, rink and skating alike have quickly grown big from the\nsmall beginnings of some seven years ago, and annually a large number of\ngood skaters spend a month\nthere. Elsewhere on the rink is a strip reserved for curlers, who have\nalso another small private rink. For tobogganers there is provided both\nan artificial snow-run for the use of luges, and for skeletons a very\ngood ice-run, not, indeed, of the arduousness of the Cresta, but fast\nand well banked. In addition bob-sleighing can be had on the\nmountain-track up to La Bretaye, and there are the usual suitable slopes\nfor luges. The place has now been open some eight years, and yearly the\nfour big hotels are crowded with visitors. Nor is this to be wondered\nat, for, apart from the excellence of its provisions for all manner of\nwinter sports, Villars, set in its pine-woods and faced by the splendid\nopen view across the valley, is possessed of an extraordinary charm of\nsituation and natural beauty.",

It is reached by\nan amazing funicular from Sierre, and is 4900 feet above sea-level.\nBehind and above it and around it stretch limitless ski-ing slopes, and\nthere are any amount of expeditions to be made from it. There are two\ngood rinks: one for curlers, another for skaters; and after a\nconsiderable period of Laodicean apathy, Montana seems to have made up\nits mind to be of the English school. But up till lately it had put its\nchief energies into ski-ing and curling, and had not pursued skating in\nthat tense and scientific spirit which it deserves. There is a fairly\ngood artificial ice-run for toboggans, and another snow-run down\nvalleywards, and plenty of those quiet, hard-trodden paths down which\nthe amateur tobogganer likes to ramble. There are two\nlakes which, when the snow has made an agreeable arrangement with the\nfrost, can be used for skating, and in summer, when the sun has come to\nan understanding with the snow, a fine golf-course is found to reveal\nitself. But all winter long the sun blazes on Montana, while its\naltitude and the cold of its nights preserves its frozen mantle. Of the\nview I have already spoken: there is something to be said for a view in\nthe intervals of falling-down, and in the meditation and quiescence\nwhich such falls sometimes entail.",

Probably in Cromwell Road they\nwould never dream, for instance, if there was a fall of snow, of making\na snow-man in the back-garden, even if the snow was not covered with\nsmuts, but out here if by chance a heavy fall renders rink and\ntoboggan-run impracticable for the moment, they are perfectly likely\n(they will not believe me, but it is quite true) to build up a sumptuous\npiece of statuary. Similarly, unaccustomed as they are to go out of\ndoors on a winter\u2019s night after dinner, except to be taken in a taxi to\nthe theatre, it is quite probable that they will don coats and gouties\nand see what is going on at this absurd ice-carnival, which they have\nbeen told is to take place on the rink.

Each carries a Chinese\nlantern on a stick, and the whole place is an intricate pattern of\ninterweaving lights and colours. Then the band rings out again\n(\u201cringing\u201d is the only word that the least describes the sound of\nviolins and horns in this resonant frosty air), and instantly this sheet\nof weaving light and figures\nbegins to be permeated by rhythm. Couple by couple are swept into this\nrhythm, circling, oscillating with long gliding steps, their lanterns\nmaking a series of luminous loops as they swing to the measure of the\ndance. What was but a company of mysterious, huge fire-flies, all\ndarting about on separate businesses, is turned into a rhythmical and\nliving pattern of flame, controlled by the lilt and measure of the band.\nEye and ear alike are dazzled by this musical and moving and illuminated\nrhythm. Faster grows the tune as it approaches its end, faster is formed\nthis living and luminous pattern. Then it stops, and the pattern\ndissolves itself again into streaks of darting lights; the dance of the\nuncontrolled fire-flies again. And it is far from unlikely that the\nmiddle-aged and sedate will hurry back to the hotel to get some skates\nand a lantern, and some sort of preposterous headgear.",
